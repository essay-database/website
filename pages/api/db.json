Through this need, I have taken on the position of Vice President with my school’s Black Student Union. As a third year officer of the Black Student Union, I have contributed to my club's efforts to provide a positive community and give back to others over a long period of time. Every year other BSU official and I are large parts of the program. I help put together everything that happen in the club. Recently, I was put in charge of officer polos. I did everything from collecting officer shirt sizes, designing the shirts, to ordering the shirts from the printing company. This year I was also put on the Club Day Team. I got to work with other members of the Black Student Union to put  together a table and an activities board, showing off our club to possible new members. I was allowed to design the board, decorate the table, and reach out to other minorities by passing out club flyers. During the holiday’s, the Black Student Union often puts on special holiday activities, my favorite of which is Thanksgiving baskets. Last Thanksgiving, me and one other member of the program were in charge of the junior class food item donation. I reached out to many of my fellow junior class mates at the time to ultimately win class to bring in the most items. But more importantly, the Black Student Union was able to supply nine families with thanksgiving dinners who may not have had one without such donations. Through the events and activities mentioned above, along with many more examples requiring dedication and commitment, I have  gained many valuable experiences helping me to see the effects of such commitment and to contribute to the Black Student Union for over three years.\n\nWhat would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?\n\nMy greatest talent is playing basketball. Growing up as an active child, I played multiple sports, but I always enjoyed basketball most of all. At first, I️ appreciated the social aspect of the sport. All I needed was a ball, a basket and a friend. Later, I grew to love the competition. Everyone wants to be the best player with the best team and the most wins. I love how if I am willing to put forward time and effort, I can become better than these opponents. As a child, my father told me to “stick to football” because I was no good at basketball, but this only encouraged me to become better at the sport that I loved. I play on an elite travel basketball team based out of Santa Ana, which is two and a half hours away from my hometown. In the last year, my team and I have traveled to places like Indianapolis and Las Vegas, and I️ have played against multiple top Division I recruits. I have come from being told to pick a new sport, to now having the opportunity to travel the nation based on my athletic abilities, but it took plenty of hard work and dedication to get to where I am today. I have sacrificed countless hours to a gym for practice, or just to get extra shots up. I have sacrificed friendships and other relationships due to lack of time or conflict in interest. I have sacrificed experiences, missing my school’s trip to France to play against one of the best travel teams in the world, Compton Magic. All of this sacrifice shows my dedication to developing my greatest talent. At the end of my junior year, my teammates selected me as the most valuable player of my varsity high school basketball team. Next year, I️ will continue to showcase my determination and will to improve by bringing the same characteristics I️ use in basketball to the college setting.\n\nDescribe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n\nIn school, I find science to be the most enjoyable of all the subjects. I like science because it requires many different skills and it challenges me to understand the world around me. For example, last year I️ was enrolled in my favorite science class, Honors Physics, where my teacher not only taught me velocity equations, but challenged me further by requiring me to reading scientific plays and discussing science fiction topics. These activities, in their unorthodox approaches on science, furthered my passion for everything science stands for; like, understanding, answers, and problem solving. These are things that I wonder about on a daily basis. Unlike many other subjects, science usually works around real word problems. A science test question may ask how fire works or how gravity affects an object rather than how to solve an equation that can be calculated through a calculator. Science is not only my favorite subject, but it has affected how I go about my daily life. Science has influenced me to question the world around me like ancient scientists once did. To have new ideas that everyone may not accept. Question how something works, how it was made, what gives it its properties. Without questions there could not be answers. Science has taught me to reach toward understanding. I try to understand something and how it works rather than just memorize an equation or formula. This does not only pertain to school and learning, but to life. I try to understand a person before judging them, understand a situation before jumping to conclusions, even attempting to understand one's actions before committing to anger. So, as I️ continue on my journey through life and into college, I️ will take the lessons I️ learned from science into my everyday life, college field, and work place, by continuing to ask these question and continuing to reach for understanding. Science has not only been my favorite subject but it has influenced my life in many ways. This is why I love science.\n\nWhat have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\n\nThis year I became a part of the 2017-2018 Ford Dream Builders. Ford Dream Builders is a very selective program, sponsored by the local Ford car dealership, geared toward building leadership skills and career readiness in high school students. We participate in multiple volunteering activities, along with being allowed to produce a large scale community service project by the end of my senior year. Of the many activities I have completed to better the community through Ford Dream Builders, I really enjoyed the “Spread the Love” event where I helped make over 500 peanut butter and jelly sack lunches for multiple local children’s organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and the Police Activities League. For myself, I got to see, first hand, how people can come together to achieve a common goal. I found it very inspiring, when I took a step back, to see all of us working so hard to better our community and put a smile on children’s faces while we light-heartedly joked and laughed amongst each other. For myself and many others “Spread the Love” was fun and social, but at the same time I️ was helping to give meals to less fortunate children who may have gone without lunch if it weren’t for myself and others like me. I️ loved this feeling. With teamwork, communication, and a desire to help, I love how I can make a difference in my community or an individual's life and have an affect on something so much greater than myself. Through my sandwich making experience I️ plan to continue with this feeling. I️ will continue to help others, while aspiring to create a fun and positive atmosphere for others willing to help those in need. I️ also want to inspire not only my friends, but everyone to get out and feel the feeling I️ felt during “Spread the Love” by having a good time while bettering people's lives.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"rejected","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":307,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97560-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time. \n\nMy story not only list all the important aspects of my life; it explains how these events define me as a person.  I want to make those who supported throughout my journey proud, especially my parents. I feel I have to prove to them I can make it in life because of the mistakes my older siblings have made.  So I feel this is important to me because I do not want to disappoint them for all the time and money they invested in me.  In addition, I want to set an example for my older and younger siblings to show them anything is possible with hard work.  I am determined to accomplish this goal by taking every opportunity possible to fulfill my dream.\n\n I am an African American male so I have a slight disadvantage toward among my students in my class.  I always get inferior looks when I am the only African American male in my advanced classes.  I am intimidated to ask questions because I feel other classmates would mock my intelligence.  This affected my grade and caused me to get my first C in math.  I was devastated and almost switched into a College Preparatory class, but I didn’t.  I thought to myself what kind of person I would be if I were to quit.  I stayed in the class and worked extra hard to prove I belong in the class.  I also took this as a learning experience; nothing is handed to you in life, you have to work for it.  \n\n \n\nThis mentality applies in sports as well.  I have played soccer for about eleven years and I love the game, despite all the negative feedback I have encountered.  When I first signed up, my uncle criticized me because soccer was not a sport that not a lot of black people played.  This criticism fueled my drive to exceed in the sport and become a dynamic player.  I started to play organized club soccer, competition is intense.  I was the only African American on a predominantly hispanic team, and their skills were sharp.  I had to train everyday outside of practice to match the skills of my teammates.  This meant staying after practice to run extra sprints, training in unbearable weather and sacrificing my social life to pursue what I love.  \n\n                    \n\nEvery person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  \n\nI have been involved in leadership programs in school and sports.  Last year, my counselor recommended me for a Youth Leadership program to represent the school.  If selected, we would be able to tour around Bakersfield studying the different economic industries.  I never seen myself as a leader.  When I was younger I was not very social and kept my feelings and emotions to myself.  It was always my mother who made plans for me and spoke on my behalf.  It got so bad that I cannot even express myself to my own father, who always told me to be my own person and communication was key.  Eventually I had to break this bad habit when I wanted to switch high schools.  It was very stressful but we came to an agreement.  After that moment, I started to become more vocal in expressing myself to people and it had a profound impact on my social life.  I began to understand my father was right about communication and how it defines you as a person.  Even though my application was not accepted, I took this as a learning experience.  I wouldn't have been recommended for this if I did not show any leadership qualities so I feel I have the skills of being a responsible leader.\n\n                      My leadership skills play a significant role in sports as well.  I wasn’t a vocal person so communicating to my teammates was difficult.  Since I was not able to communicate, it was difficult to manage the game.  As a result, it lead to a rough season of losses due.  It was tough seeing my teammates give up, so I decided next season was going to be different.  In one of our practices, I stepped out of my comfort zone and forced myself to communicate and it turned out very effective.  I began to incorporate this into our games and it resulted in our team winning league.  Even though I wasn’t an official captain, I was viewed as a resilient leader.\n\nThink about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. \n\nMy favorite academic subject will always be math.  I love problem solving and being able to figure them out on my own.  I feel I acquired the love for math from my father because he loves figuring things out by himself and will never be satisfied until it is solved, no matter how long it takes.  Since math came natural to me, I was arrogant and did not need any help figuring out problems.  Also, I always got A’s and B’s in all of my math classes so I never needed help.  This mentality was pretty evident in my Precalculus class when I had got my first C.  So I came to the realization that asking for help doesn’t make me incompetent to solve problems.    \n\nI love math because it pertains to the potential career I want to pursue in.  My first career option is Mechanical Engineering.  I was intrigued by the hands-on part of the job, the problem-solving aspect and the numerous amount of mathematics involved.  In addition, the applications of this career varies so you are not limited to a specific job.  I was also fascinated by this career because I want to create something that is beneficial to my community.  I am not as involved in my community as I should be, but I do as much as I can to provide for it.  I volunteer through Frito-Lay and we donate to people less fortunate.  Every year, Frito-Lay does a backpack drive at a local Boys and Girls Club and we donate about 100 backpacks with various amount of school supplies to kids who cannot afford the simple essentials.  It makes me feel good to volunteer to help people in different communities.  I feel they look up to me for making an impact on their communities, no matter how big or small. \n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.        \n\nMy open-mindedness has helped me take advantage of various opportunities and resources presented to me.  I am always happy to broaden my scope with new options that are beneficial to my future.  It was not until my sophomore year that I started to express myself and become more vocal.  In turn, I became more involved in BSU and developed a close relationship with my advisor.  She then recommended me for the Experience Berkeley program.  She informed me that Berkeley was looking to raise its diversity rate by reaching out to minority group who meet the exceptional qualifications they were looking for.  So I filled out the application and I got accepted.  I did not have a clue about the admission process and how fast the deadline was approaching.  However, my mentor at Berkeley helped by simplifying everything to ensure that I understood everything.  I am glad I took this opportunity because I got a headstart on the admission process and information about college that I would have never figured out on my own.  In addition, I am grateful I was given this opportunity because raises my chances in getting into a college and making my parents proud.\n\n I am the first to take initiative when it pertains to success in my future.  For instance, I love the game of soccer and want to pursue it after high school, so I do everything in my power to make sure I turn that dream in a reality. It was not until the beginning of junior year that I learned about how to get a soccer scholarship.  I had to email coaches of the colleges I was interested in and make online recruiting accounts.  I could not afford to go to many of the college camps I wanted to go to, so I was upset that I was missing an opportunity to meet with coaches face-to-face.  However, I got feedback from a lot of coaches I contacted and I was ecstatic because I am equipped to play at a college level and now my dreams are turning into a reality.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"true","image":175,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97561-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"And on that Note\n\nThe sound was loud and discordant, like a hurricane, high notes and low notes mixing together in an audible mess. It was as if a thousand booming foghorns were in a shouting match with sirens. Unlike me, this was a little abrasive and loud. I liked it. It was completely unexpected and extremely fun to play.\n\nSome instruments are built to make multiple notes, like a piano. A saxophone on the other hand doesn’t play chords but single notes through one vibrating reed. However, I discovered that you can play multiple notes simultaneously on the saxophone. While practicing a concert D-flat scale, I messed up a fingering for a low B-flat, and my instrument produced a strange noise with two notes. My band teacher got very excited and exclaimed, “Hey, you just played a polyphonic note!” I like it when accidents lead to discovering new ideas.\n\nI like this polyphonic sound because it reminds me of myself: many things at once. You assume one thing and get another. At school, I am a course scholar in English, but I am also able to amuse others when I come up with wince evoking puns. My math and science teachers expect me to go into engineering, but I’m more excited about making films. Discussing current events with my friends is fun, but I also like to share with them my secrets to cooking a good scotch egg. Even though my last name gives them a hint, the Asian students at our school don’t believe that I’m half Japanese. Meanwhile the non-Asians are surprised that I’m also part Welsh. I feel comfortable being unique or thinking differently. As a Student Ambassador this enables me to help freshman and others who are new to our school feel welcome and accepted. I help the new students know that it’s okay to be themselves.\n\nThere is added value in mixing things together. I realized this when my brother and I won an international Kavli Science Foundation contest where we explained the math behind the Pixar movie “Up”. Using stop motion animation we explored the plausibility and science behind lifting a house with helium balloons. I like offering a new view and expanding the way people see things. In many of my videos I combine art with education. I want to continue making films that not only entertain, but also make you think.\n\nA lot of people have a single passion that defines them or have a natural talent for something specific. Like my saxophone I am an instrument, but I can play many notes at once. I’m a scholar and a musician. Quiet but talkative. An athlete and a filmmaker. Careful but spontaneous. A fan of Johnny Cash and Kill The Noise. Hard working but playful. A martial artist and a baker. One of a kind but an identical twin.\n\nWill polyphonic notes resonate in college? Yes. For instance, balancing a creative narrative with scientific facts will make a more believable story. I want to bring together different kinds of students (such as music, film, and English majors) to create more meaningful art. Understanding fellow students’ perspective, talents, and ideas are what build a great community.\n\nI’m looking forward to discovering my place in the world by combining various interests. Who I am doesn’t always harmonize and may seem like nothing but noise to some. But what I play, no matter how discordant, can be beautiful. It’s my own unique polyphonic note.","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":201,"date":"2018-11-11T04:15:23.063Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97562-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n\nBeing a SOAR Ambassador has been one of the most satisfying high school activities for me thus far. Mentoring students empowers me to be an engaging leader; I have learned to blend their unfamiliarity with my experience. My desire to become a SOAR Ambassador is that no one in my home knew how to help me in school, and I want to provide my knowledge to the kids who are like me and need guidance and help. I was entrusted with six students, three each year; each attempting to find themselves, in this dual-enrollment high school and college setting. I am a leader to these girls, and I love it because I'm influencing them to be smarter, stronger, and better altogether. At the request of one mentee, I helped her plan her next four years of high school and guide her on how to get an AA degree. That plan I made for her turned into a form, that I created for the entire school to use, to plan out how to get an AA if desired. On another occasion, I helped tutor my mentees in math and their skills and scores improved. In a survey assessing mentors, my mentees reported that I was doing exceptionally well as their mentor, and along with other successful mentors, we were rewarded with tickets to a UCLA Bruins basketball game. The skills that generated the positive feedback on the survey were my planning, communication, and caring, which I express amongst my mentees. I expressed these skills by tutoring them, helping their time-management by planning, and listening to them. My mentees are now better prepared for the rest of high school and I continue to do this even today. My traits as an overachieving student are blending into these kids, and I can see how I'm affecting my school community positively by contributing to the success of the kids who want to achieve things in life. This experience is teaching me what it means to be a leader and gives me purpose to engage in programs where I can give back to my community.\n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nApplying and being accepted into SOAR High School, an early college high school, located on the Antelope Valley Community College campus, has been the biggest educational advantage I've taken. In this program students are concurrently enrolled in high school and college for all four years. It allows kids an opportunity to achieve an AA degree or complete IGETC transfer requirements. By the time I graduate I will have 60 units in college, two associate degrees, and completion of the honors program at AVC. The college courses and textbooks are paid for through an agreement between SOAR High School and AVC, and it is an amazing opportunity to take college classes while in high school. Joining this high school program was a great significant educational opportunity because I am making a contribution to my education and my future, along with my participation in clubs and community service. Making this decision was huge because I sacrificed a regular comprehensive high school experience; we are a small school community, with about 400 students, no sports and few clubs. I had to be mature enough to handle the dual enrollment. I was ready to take on this program because I knew this program would be an amazing educational opportunity. From the experience I learned to be more mature and it has prepared me for a University.\n\nOn top of SOAR itself, joining the honors program at AVC is another significant educational opportunity in addition to my original goal of graduating from AVC and SOAR. It is a challenge for me because it is extra coursework on top of the regular college course requirements. My honors classes consist of many intriguing class discussions, research papers, and heavy communication with professors. With this honors program, six of my 60 college course units will receive honors college credit, making me an honor certified student. Doing the honors program at AVC has shaped me with integrity, maturity, and ambition. \n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nBeginning in the 5th grade, I started having migraines, and they came twice a week with throw up. I had problems concentrating and getting work done because my head would be thumping with massive pain, and it created a massive amount of stress, as it challenged my perseverance. I began seeing a neurologist, taking on-set medication, all while dealing with tests, quizzes, and lectures on top of the pain. Starting freshman year of high school, I had migraines every day lasting throughout the day. Six month visits with my neurologist and prescribed daily medication became a way of life for me, until the migraines returned. The next treatment was an intravenous therapy session, which failed, and then another daily medication that gave me ALL the listed reactions and caused me to be bedridden. Following the sickness I began having massages from the waist up for the pain and fortunately my migraines were completely eliminated. \n\nDuring this entire time I've dealt with migraines, it's been hard to stay at school and focus with such pain, but I do, because I feel school is very important and as long as the pain is tolerable to an extent, I manage. The times I've happened to miss school, I never allowed myself to fall behind, regardless of my pain; I would get my work done. It really challenged me to be 100% when my body only felt 50%, but I managed because my dedication is to my education. I got through by getting healthy with good eating habits, a good sleep routine, and learning to manage my stress. I had to ensure my eating habits included three meals a day, always breakfast, snacks, and plenty of water. The other adjustment was in my sleep patterns to determine the amount of hours of sleep necessary to feel at my best. It taught me how to manage my pain and stress by putting forth a mindset to cover for the temporal lack of physical strength within me. In overcoming this challenge, I learned that I can conquer anything impeding my academic achievement. \n\nBeyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?\n\nAs a driven and intelligent Latina, I've proven to myself and others that I will not accept the same environment I was raised in and simply accept it, but instead I'm fighting to live and become better than the circumstances I was brought up in. I've grown up with a binge drinker dad and a mother who loves to gamble at casinos. When my dad binge drinks, for weeks at a time, my mom will go to the casino and leave me with whoever will watch me till she gets back. My parents provide and care for me, but during these times, I feel invisible, and it hurts my mental state and affects my ability to focus on my education. During the times when I couldn't go home I learned to arrange my life so that my home situation didn't interfere with school. I had to keep track of what needed to be in my backpack to make sure I'd be able to do my schoolwork while my parents decided to not act as parents. I had to grow up quickly to be able to take care of myself as best as I could with my living circumstances. Despite having no parents to care for me in those bad moments, I took this time to make a life of my own and create a resilient personality in myself. I've managed to maintain great grades in a challenging school, care for myself, be involved in my community, and next May, I will graduate from high school with my diploma and a week later, I'll graduate from community college with two AA degrees. I didn't let anything or anyone stop me since childhood, although I lived this lifestyle I promised myself I wouldn't let this be my future. I believe my experience sets me apart because few students are able to change the trajectory of their life at such a young age. What I learned is that I control my education, which determines my future.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"waitlisted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":147,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97563-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Smeared blood, shredded feathers. Clearly, the bird was dead. But wait, the slight fluctuation of its chest, the slow blinking of its shiny black eyes. No, it was alive.\n\n I had been typing an English essay when I heard my cat's loud meows and the flutter of wings. I had turned slightly at the noise and had found the barely breathing bird in front of me.\n\nThe shock came first. Mind racing, heart beating faster, blood draining from my face. I instinctively reached out my hand to hold it, like a long-lost keepsake from my youth. But then I remembered that birds had life, flesh, blood.\n\nDeath. Dare I say it out loud? Here, in my own home?\n\nWithin seconds, my reflexes kicked in. Get over the shock. Gloves, napkins, towels. Band-aid? How does one heal a bird? I rummaged through the house, keeping a wary eye on my cat. Donning yellow rubber gloves, I tentatively picked up the bird. Never mind the cat's hissing and protesting scratches, you need to save the bird. You need to ease its pain.\n\nBut my mind was blank. I stroked the bird with a paper towel to clear away the blood, see the wound. The wings were crumpled, the feet mangled. A large gash extended close to its jugular rendering its breathing shallow, unsteady. The rising and falling of its small breast slowed. Was the bird dying? No, please, not yet. \n\nWhy was this feeling so familiar, so tangible?\n\nOh. Yes. The long drive, the green hills, the white church, the funeral. The Chinese mass, the resounding amens, the flower arrangements. Me, crying silently, huddled in the corner. The Hsieh family huddled around the casket. Apologies. So many apologies. Finally, the body  lowered to rest. The body. Kari Hsieh. Still familiar, still tangible.\n\nHugging Mrs. Hsieh, I was a ghost, a statue. My brain and my body competed. Emotion wrestled with fact. Kari Hsieh, aged 17, my friend of four years, had died in the Chatsworth Metrolink Crash on Sep. 12, 2008. Kari was dead, I thought. Dead.\n\nBut I could still save the bird.\n\nMy frantic actions heightened my senses, mobilized my spirit. Cupping the bird, I ran outside, hoping the cool air outdoors would suture every wound, cause the bird to miraculously fly away. Yet there lay the bird in my hands, still gasping, still dying. Bird, human, human, bird. What was the difference? Both were the same. Mortal.\n\nBut couldn't I do something? Hold the bird longer, de-claw the cat? I wanted to go to my bedroom, confine myself to tears, replay my memories, never come out. \n\nThe bird's warmth faded away. Its heartbeat slowed along with its breath. For a long time, I stared thoughtlessly at it, so still in my hands.\n\nSlowly, I dug a small hole in the black earth. As it disappeared under handfuls of dirt, my own heart grew stronger, my own breath more steady.\n\nThe wind, the sky, the dampness of the soil on my hands whispered to me, “The bird is dead. Kari has passed. But you are alive.” My breath, my heartbeat, my sweat sighed back, “I am alive. I am alive. I am alive.”","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":374,"date":"2018-11-11T06:04:49.677Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97564-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"My favorite word in the Spanish language is el pollo. I like the way the double “l” rolls off my tongue and how my lips purse to pronounce the “p”.  A rightful assumption is that el pollo is some beautiful word, a word signifying hope or love, or that at the very least, it epitomizes some circumstance in my life in a meaningful way. In reality, it translates to “the chicken”.\n\nI started learning Spanish in the seventh grade. Because it was a trimester course, we only learned the basics, but mastering numbers and colors didn’t hold my interest. Sure, I could count to ten and describe the color of the sky, but I couldn’t hold a conversation. When I got to eighth grade, however, Spanish occupied my thoughts, especially when I realized how good I was at it.\n\nAs I continued into high school, my Spanish skills flourished. I began to think in Spanish, palabras (words) swirling inside my head, interchanging with English. I found myself complaining about English and its lacklusterness and difficulty in comparison to Spanish (English’s lack of an usted form, for example). My friends spoke French, but that didn’t stop me from replying to their questions in Spanish. Foreign words, unknown to me and not necessarily Spanish, stumbled out of my mouth with a Spanish accent. To the bewilderment of my friends, I write out lists of Spanish verbs for fun. Simply put, Spanish consumed my life.\n\nHowever, in the spring of my freshman year, it wasn’t Spanish exhausting my brain; instead, it was the brain abscess pressing on my mom’s. Spending my evenings in the hospital, I watched as the abscess paralyzed the left fingers she had intertwined with mine, weaken the legs she had ran marathons with, and constrained my shopping partner to a hospital bed. For a month, I was sullen, the world whisking around me, while I ached with pain of the possibility of losing my mother.\n\nI used my love of Spanish to ease the pain. The phrase, el pollo es mi comida favorita, a skipping track, prevented me from thinking about the situation, while conjugating verbs into different tenses restrained the shakiness of my voice and the tears forming in my eyes.

I, in turn, have struggled immensely with the\n\nparadoxical use of this label.\n\nSince the onset of my tween years and perhaps even before that, I have constantly\n\ncarried with me an insistent urge for nonconformity; it has never sat well with me to be like\n\neveryone else. Throughout my middle school years, this natural instinct of mine manifested\n\nitself in many different ways: jeans tucked into knee-high socks, anything from punk to Harlem\n\nrenaissance jazz bellowing from my headphones, Palahniuk novels peeking out of my\n\nbackpack. As my identity shifted, my career as a social renegade flourished, and I found in\n\nmyself a certain pride in being different and a passion for seeking out eccentric new ways to\n\nexpress myself.\n\nWith the realization of my newfound passion, my nonconformist qualities were locked\n\nin, and I began high school without the usual freshman trepidation about getting labeled or\n\nbranded. Thereby, I continued my habitual antics, rebelling against the social norm and doing\n\nwhat I could to think freely. In doing so, however, I encountered a particular subculture\n\ndefined by certain fashion trends and, to some extent, genres of music. This subculture was\n\nand still is often associated with the term \"hipster\" and regarded as having a correspondence\n\nwith the \"hipster lifestyle.\" Moreover, so-called \"hipsters\" are known to have particularly\n\npoignant tendencies towards nonconformity. Thus, my rise to the hipster ideal began.\n\nI was enamored with various aspects of this subculture, so I enthusiastically donned a\n\nbeanie and cardigan and crammed every Bon Iver and The Smiths album I could find on to\n\nmy iPod. Such new developments in my identity perfectly suited my singularity as a\n\nnonconformist; no one I knew had adopted this flair. Admittedly, my new garb was somewhat\n\nfunky, and thus the new look evoked, in both positive and negative renditions, choruses of\n\n\"You're such a hipster!\" The attention was extraordinarily gratifying, and I consequently\n\nplunged into obsession with my new label, consumed in an effort to sustain my \"hipster\"\n\nreputation. Much of my mental vitality was spent on keeping my appearance and status up to\n\na sufficiently \"hipster\" standard. The questions I asked myself about who I wanted to be\n\nquickly evolved into \"How can I fit the ideal?\" and \"How can I conform?\"\n\nHerein lies the continual paradox for people who identify themselves as \"hipsters\" and\n\nthe contradiction that brought me much confusion and uncertainty for parts of my high school\n\ncareer: implicit in the definition of the term \"hipster\" is the prominence of nonconformity in all\n\naspects of a \"hipster's\" lifestyle. Individualist ideals permeate his clothes, his music, his social\n\nbehavior, even his politics. Simultaneously, however, one who seeks to identify himself and\n\nbe identified by others as a \"hipster\" undoubtably strives to conform to the \"hipster\" construct;\n\nhe tries to fit himself inside an inflexible \"hipster\" box.\n\nNevertheless, as with most paradoxes, the problem at hand does not imply a real\n\ncontradiction. I found the solution after many months of personal struggle with my own\n\nidentity. It is not that there is something inherently wrong with the qualities of a \"hipster.\" I\n\nhave come to understand that a label such as \"hipster\" must never precede my own actual\n\ncharacteristics, and I can never let such a notion inform my identity by itself. Before I ever\n\nbegin to set words to my character, I have to figure out who I am free from outside influence.\n\nThe adjectives come much later.","prompt":"","college":"Columbia University","status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"","image":143,"date":"2018-11-11T06:52:01.978Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97566-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"I plan to double major in biochemistry and English and my main essay explains my passion for the former; here is a writing sample that illustrates my enthusiasm for the latter.\n\nIn my AP Literature class, my teacher posed a question to which students had to write a creative response. My response is framed around the ideas of Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave.”\n\nQ: Why did the chicken cross the road?\n\nA: A manicured green field of grass blades cut to perfectly matched lengths; a blue expanse ornamented with puffy cotton clouds; an immaculately painted red barn centered exactly at the top of a hill--the chicken gazes contentedly at his picturesque world. Within an area surrounded by a shiny silver fence, he looks around at his friends: roosters pecking at a feast of grains and hens lounging on luxurious cushions of hay. As the nice man in a plaid shirt and blue jeans collects the hens’ eggs, the chicken feels an overwhelming sense of indebtedness to him for providing this idyllic lifestyle.\n\nOn a day as pristine as all the others, the chicken is happily eating his lunchtime meal as the nice man carefully gathers the smooth white eggs when it notices that the man has left one behind. Strangely located at the empty end of the metal enclosure, highlighted by the bright yellow sun, the white egg appears to the chicken different from the rest. The chicken moves towards the light to tacitly inform the man of his mistake. But then the chicken notices a jagged gray line on the otherwise flawless egg. Hypnotized and appalled, the chicken watches as the line turns into a crack and a small beak attached to a fuzzy yellow head pokes out. Suddenly a shadow descends over the chicken and the nice man snatches the egg--the baby chick--and stomps off.\n\nThe chicken--confused, betrayed, disturbed--slowly lifts its eyes from the now empty ground. For the first time, it looks past the silver fence of the cage and notices an unkempt sweep of colossal brown and green grasses opposite its impeccably crafted surroundings. Cautiously, it inches closer to the barrier, farther from the unbelievable perfection of the farm, and discovers a wide sea of black gravel.  Stained with gray stones and marked with yellow lines, it separates the chicken from the opposite field.\n\nThe curious chicken quickly shuffles to Mother Hen, who has just settled on to her throne of hay and is closing her eyes. He is sure that the always composed and compassionate chicken will help him make sense of what he’s just seen.\n\n“Mother Hen, Mother Hen! I-I just saw one of those eggs, cracking, and there was a small yellow bird inside. It was a baby. Are those eggs that the nice man takes away babies? And that black ground! What is it?” the chicken blurts out.\n\nHer eyes flick open. “BOK BOK! Don’t you ever dare speak of what you have seen again,” Mother Hen snaps in a low and violent whisper, “or all of this will be taken away.” Closing her eyes again, she dismisses the chicken.\n\nFrozen in disbelief, the chicken tries to make sense of her harsh words. It replays the incident in its head. “All the food, the nice soft hay, the flawless red barn--maybe all of this isn’t worth giving up. Maybe Mother Hen is right. She just wants to protect me from losing it all.” The chicken replays the incident again. “But it was a baby. What if it was hers? She still wouldn’t care. She’s being selfish; all she cares about is this perfect life.” A final replay, and the chicken realizes and accepts that Mother Hen knows, has known, that the man is doing something wrong; yet she has yielded to the cruelty for her own comfort. A fissure in the chicken’s unawareness, a plan begins to hatch. The chicken knows it must escape; it has to get to the other side.\n\n“That man in the plaid shirt is stealing the eggs from their mothers again,” the chicken thinks the next day as he unlocks the cage. Then the man reaches into the wooden coop, his back to the entrance. “Now!” At its own cue, the chicken scurries towards the opening and exits unseen. With a backwards glance at his friends, the chicken feels a profound sadness and pity for their ignorance. It wants to urge them to open their eyes, to see what they are sacrificing for materialistic pleasures, but he knows they will not surrender the false reality. Alone, the chicken dashes away.\n\nThe chicken stands at the line between green grass and black gravel. As it prepares to take its first step into the unknown, a monstrous vehicle with 18 wheels made of metal whizzes by, leaving behind a trail of gray exhaust. Once it regains its breath, it moves a few inches onto the asphalt. Three more speeding trucks stop its chicken heart.\n\n“I can’t do this,” it says to itself. “These monsters are a sign. They’re telling me to go back. Besides, a few lost chicks aren’t so bad. The man’s not that evil. He gives us food, and a home.”\n\nBut the chicken dismisses the cowardly voice in its head, reminding itself of the injustice back in the deceptively charming prison. Over the next several hours, it learns to strategically position itself so that it is in line with the empty space between the tires of passing trucks. It reaches the yellow dashes. A black blanket gradually pushes away the glowing sun and replaces it with diamond stars and a glowing crescent. It reaches the untouched field.\n\nWith a deep breath, the chicken steps into the swathe, a world of tall beige grass made brown by the darkness. Unsure of what it may discover, it determines to simply walk straight through the brush, out on to the other side. For what seems like forever, it continues forward, as the black sky turns to purple, then blue, then pink. Just as the chicken begins to regret its journey, the grass gives way to a vast landscape of trees, bushes, flowers--heterogeneous and variable, but nonetheless perfect. In a nearby tree, the chicken spots two adult birds tending to a nest of babies--a natural dynamic of individuals unaltered by corrupt influence.\n\nAnd then it dawns on him. It has escaped from a contrived and perverted domain as well as its own unawareness; it has arrived in a place where the pure order of the world reigns.\n\n“I know the truth now,” it thinks to himself as the sun rises. “But here, in Nature, it is of no use. Back home, I need to try to foster awareness among my friends, share this understanding with them. Otherwise, I am as cruel as the man in the plaid shirt, taking away the opportunity to overcome ignorance.\n\n“I must return now; I have to get to the other side.","prompt":"","college":"University of Chicago","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Illinois","featured":"","image":180,"date":"2018-11-11T06:14:24.941Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97567-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"I wended my way through the first through fourth grades mostly without speaking. My presentations during that time went in two parts: a stilted “My name is ---,” then some sort of pantomime. So I was surprised when I got a part in the class play, notwithstanding that everybody got a part. I played the part of Ernest Hemingway without uttering a word. Perhaps my fifth grade teacher wished to show Hemingway’s taciturn spirit. Perhaps it was that playing the Hemingway part consisted of two appearances: walking through the stage like an old man, holding an aquamarine paper C, and giving a tearful farewell to some bare arms.\n\nSeven years later, I was to convince two hundred and twenty members of the Torrey Pines NHS that I should be their secretary. Mr. Chess, the club advisor, had warned the members not to clap, since there were five other applicants for the post of secretary alone. We did not have the time — only twenty-five minutes in the lunch hour — needed to get this over with.\n\nI compressed my planned speech, compressed my motions until I could drown out that throng’s roar. Mr. Chess ended up standing up and clapping, too, in the end.\n\nMore important than results, though, is the process of how I learned to speak and enunciate:\n\nStick a pen in your mouth. Hold it like a dog holds a bone, with the ends sticking out.\n\nPreferably a pen which you own.\n\nDijyoo duwit? Chan’t enunsiate, khan yoo?\n\nRead a speech without taking it out. Breathe through your gaping mouth and enunciate, even though you cannot. If you can do this impossible thing, you can enunciate while making a normal, unencumbered speech. Your mouth opens wide, enough to fit your hand into. That’s the basic point of classical technique, the kind that preachers and other unamplified orators practice. It can deafen the back row.\n\nThere is a second part, though, in this technique. The Pen Drill cannot truly be done alone. It needs to be done in front of people who laugh at the ridiculousness of the drill, because then the second realization comes— those people are not laughing at you. They laugh at the spectacle, the absurdity of the stretched mouth, and if you laugh at it too, you laugh together. Laugh together. If you can do this impossibility, you can look at any audience and stay composed.\n\nIt took more than The Pen Drill™ to turn myself into a presenter. One time practicing is not enough. One technique, one drill is not enough. I inserted “banana” in words, declaimed upside-down holding up weights, and excised the word “um” from my vocabulary permanently. Then the practicalities: I had to write speeches and make speeches. I practiced making an entrance, making an exit, marking a beginning and curtly finishing. I saw the music in the words, realized the limited but infinite range of pitch and tone that a speaker can command.\n\nMost of all, however, I laughed.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2015,"status":"accepted","author":"Anonymous","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":1,"date":"2018-11-21T22:09:13.107Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97568-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Learning How to Play\n\nThe first board game I ever played was Disney Princess Monopoly against my mother. It was a shocking experience. My otherwise loving and compassionate mother played to win. Though she patiently explained her strategies throughout the game, she refused to show me any mercy, accumulating one monopoly after another, building house after house, hotel after hotel, and collecting all my money until I was bankrupt, despite my pleas and tears that I was her daughter and only five years old. I remember clearly the pain I felt from losing, but I remained eager to play and determined to one day beat her. Eventually, we left the princesses behind and graduated to the regular, then the deluxe, editions of Monopoly, and expanded to Rummikub. Every time we played, I carefully observed my mother’s moves and habits while considering my own options. Over the years, she continued to beat me in both games, but the contests became more competitive and my losses more narrow. Finally, at twelve, I won for the first time, at Rummikub no less, a game at which she claimed to be undefeated! I felt an overwhelming sense of pride, which was only magnified when I saw the same emotion in my mother’s face.\n\nI learned so much from these games beyond the obvious. I learned how to lose, and win, graciously. I learned to enjoy the process, regardless of the outcome. I learned how to take cues from other people but think on my own, both creatively and strategically. I learned how to cope with failure and turn it into a lesson. I learned that true victory stems from hard work and persistence. And I learned that the strongest and most meaningful relationships are not based on indulgence but on honesty and respect.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that losses don’t sting. I was devastated when my hockey team lost the championship game by only one goal when I was the last one to control the puck. But I was still incredibly proud of my team’s cohesiveness, the fluid effort we put into the season, and my own contribution. More importantly, the camaraderie and support of my teammates is ongoing and something I will always cherish more than a win. I didn’t dwell over what could have been. Instead, I focused on what I was going to take with me into the next season.\n\nThis past summer, I had my first substantive work experience interning at the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, researching and writing about treatments and therapies. Working there was certainly not a game, but my strategy was the same: work hard, remain focused, be mindful and respectful of those around me, deal with the inevitable curveballs, and take constructive criticism to heart, all in pursuit of a meaningful goal. At first, I found it intimidating, but I quickly found my footing. I worked hard, knowing that what I took away from the experience would be measured by what I put into it. I studied my co-workers: how they conducted themselves, how they interacted with each other, and how they approached their respective jobs. I carefully reviewed redlines on my writing assignments, tried not to get discouraged, and responded to the comments to present the material more effectively. I absorbed the stories relayed by Parkinson’s patients regarding their struggles and was amazed at how empowered they felt by their participation in clinical trials. Through them, I discovered what it really means to fight to win. I have also come to understand that sometimes a game never ends but transforms, causing goals to shift that may require an adjustment in strategy.\n\nMy mother and I still regularly play games, and we play to win. However, the match is now more balanced and I’ve noticed my mother paying much more attention to my moves and habits and even learning a few things from me.","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"true","image":964,"date":"2018-11-11T04:19:01.490Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97569-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Looking Through a Wider Lens\n\nWhat does it mean to be an advocate? I didn’t find the answer in any sort of textbook. Not the anatomy textbook that lay across the foot of my bed, filled with Post-Its and half-drawn diagrams. Nor the chemistry textbook that sat on top of it, covered in streaks of blue highlighter. Not even Principles of Biology, overflowing with illegible notes and loose worksheets, had the answer. Yet, in a few years, I will be promising to do just that: be the ultimate advocate for my patients.\n\nMy search for the answer began quite unintentionally. When I was initially recommended to serve on the Youth Council my junior year of high school, my perspective on civic engagement was one of apathy and a complete lack of interest. I couldn’t understand how my passion for the medical field had any correlation with serving as a representative for the students at my school and actively engaging within the political sphere. I knew I wanted to pursue a career as a physician, and I was perfectly content embracing the safety net of my introverted textbook world.\n\nBut that safety net was ripped wide open the day I walked through the sliding double doors of City Hall for my first Youth Council meeting. I assumed I would spend my hour flipping through flashcards and studying for next week’s unit test, while a bunch of teenagers complained about the lack of donuts in the student store. Instead, I listened to the stories of 18 students, all of whom were using their voices to reshape the distribution of power within their communities and break the structures that chained so many in a perpetual cycle of desperation and despair. While I spent most of my time poring over a textbook trying to memorize formulas and theorems, they were spending their time using those formulas and theorems to make a difference in their communities. Needless to say, that meeting sparked an inspirational flame within me.\n\nThe next Youth Council meeting, I asked questions. I gave feedback. I noticed what the students at my school were really struggling with. For the first time, I went to drug prevention assemblies and helped my friends run mental health workshops. The more involved I became in my city’s Youth Council, the more I understood how similar being an advocate for your community is to being an advocate for your patients. When I volunteered at the hospital every week, I started paying attention to more than whether or not my patients wanted ice chips in their water. I learned that Deborah was campaigning for equal opportunity housing in a deeply segregated neighborhood and George was a paramedic who injured his leg carrying an 8-year-old with an allergic reaction to the Emergency Room. I might not have been the doctor who diagnosed them but I was often the one person who saw them as human beings rather than patients.\n\nYouth Council isn’t something most students with a passion in practicing medicine chose to participate in, and it certainly wasn’t something I thought would have such an immense impact on the way I view patient care. As a patient’s ultimate advocate, a physician must look beyond hospital gowns and IV tubes and see the world through the eyes of another. Rather than treat diseases, a physician must choose to treat a person instead, ensuring compassionate care is provided to all. While I know that throughout my academic career I will take countless classes that will teach me everything from stoichiometry to cellular respiration, I refuse to take the knowledge I learn and simply place it on a flashcard to memorize. I will use it to help those whom I must be an advocate for: my patients.","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":30,"date":"2018-11-11T04:51:26.541Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756a-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Our Experimental College encourages current students to develop and teach a class for the Tufts community.

As I sat there, finishing up my second grade math homework, he greeted me with his trademark whimsical, yet tired, smile. His appearance:  a faded, worn-out shirt and durable, dusty jeans; his hands, caked with the grime and dirt that come with his line of work; his hair, on the verge of being assaulted with grey, covered in dust. After washing his hands, his greatest tools for his trade, he sat down with his reheated dinner, prepared by his loving wife forty minutes earlier. Without a word, he began to eat, aching for food after a long day of work. My second grade self couldn't help but notice the juxtaposition in play: a man in old, well-worn clothes, with dusty hair and hands not completely cleaned, dining in a room meticulously and somewhat ornately furnished, the fruit of his labor. We both sat there in silence. I could not help but look at my father the car mechanic in awe, considering where I myself might end up when I am his age.         \n\n\"Cessi, et sublato montes genitore petivi.\" I just have one final line in book two of Vergil's Aeneid, line 804. I gaze at the line for a moment before attacking it. I note how both \"sublato\" and \"genitore\" are ablative; they go together. I spot \"cessi,\" the verb meaning \"I yielded\", and \"petivi,\" which means \"I sought\". \"Montes\" in this scenario is in the accusative case, which means it is the direct object. I translate the line to, \"I yielded, and lifting my father I sought the mountains.\" I sat back, pleased with myself for finishing the second book of the renowned epic poem. Just then, my own father opened the door. Over dinner that night, we had another rousing talk regarding my looming college process. This talk was different, however; this was the night when I finally inform my dad of my intention to major in my favorite school topic, the classics. Upon hearing this news, my father's countenance was obscure, untranslatable.           \n\nWhen my parents were growing up in Ireland, an apprenticeship was far more valuable than college education. My parents did not attend college because apprentices got jobs sooner than those who went to college. Through apprenticeship my father got his first job. I realize the vast differences between my father's work and what I want to make my life's work. His is a realistic one: a job that was needed back then and is needed even more so today. It is a grueling work, in which one must use their hands and bodies to complete. Mine is perhaps less realistic. The classics once thrived; it was required curriculum at many private schools. The industry has only gone downhill since then, with fewer and fewer students taking the risk to learn the subject. It demands a high level of thinking, with much less physical requirements. Ultimately, I am grateful for my opportunity. My dad worked hard his entire life so that his own children got the chance to attend college to study and become what they want to be, and not what they needed to be for monetary reasons. My father is my hero for working hard, succeeding, and allowing me such a chance.         \n\nDespite his early doubt, when he soon learned that I did have a plan, which was that I wanted to teach the classics, my dad was at ease. That was all he needed to know. In my father's words, he said that if I had a plan that I was serious about, he would always fully support me. I was overjoyed by the fact that I, much like the pious hero Aeneas, would be able to carry my father, my past, with me toward my unknown future, rather than leave him behind, forever stuck in my past, a memory.","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"true","image":1044,"date":"2018-11-11T05:21:21.466Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756b-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Whether you've built blanket forts or circuit boards, created slam poetry or mixed media installations, tell us: What have you invented, engineered, produced, or designed? Or what do you hope to?\n\nWhen problems arise, I solve them using copper fittings.\n\nI first discovered this versatile building material as a seven-year-old visiting my father's HVAC shop. While waiting for him to finish working one night, I wandered from the modestly finished space at the front of the building to the shop in back, which featured high ceilings and imposing stacks of shelves. I was fascinated by the dusty machines with tubes, knobs, and old cracked nozzles. When Dad found me shoulder-deep in the scrap copper bin--which I later referred to as \"the world's coolest trash can\"--he determined that it was time to teach me to solder. Thirty minutes later, armed with a bowl haircut, a pair of safety glasses, and a healthy dose of self-confidence, I was ready to take on the world.\n\nFrom then on, my childhood was a patchwork of failures. I fell into a constant cycle of thinking, designing, building, and rethinking. Common Christmas wish list items included drafting supplies and architectural stencils. Each childhood interest led me back to the shop, where I figured out a way to build it from copper fittings. Learning to play trombone inspired me to design my own instrument. After a faulty mouthpiece and soldering mistakes ruined three prototypes, \"The Plumbone,\" an instrument that could play three distinct notes, became my first successful creation. When a middle school acids and bases project called for building a paper maché volcano, I built a cannon instead. Though my first model failed to \"erupt,\" my second sprayed its contents so far that it left a swath of dead grass in my lawn. While the grass grew back, I built a soapbox car entirely out of copper and steel strut channel only to find myself claiming last place in the annual \"Soapbox Derby.\" Noting that the lightest cars accelerated quickest, I rebuilt my car, replacing steel with PVC pipe, and took second the next year. Having navigated around so many obstacles, I imagined that I could build anything so long as I had copper fittings.\n\nAs I matured, however, I began to drift away from my old standby. While attempting increasingly abstract projects, I grew frustrated by the limitations of copper fittings. It felt like the end of an era when I decided to build one last copper item, a small creature that I gifted to my dad. \n\nLeaving the familiarity of copper behind felt like entering a new, entirely foreign world. Embracing the freedom and uncertainty of Python, I began coding my newest idea: a game called \"Dive.\" While the concept proved exhaustingly ambitious, success seemed imminent as I stitched my project together, patch by patch. Yet when I looked through my computer one morning, I realized that \"Dive\" was gone, wiped inadvertently during a visit to the Apple store. I stared in disbelief at the blank computer screen, wondering if my vision was lost forever.\n\nAt this pivotal moment, I realized why copper fittings represent such an important part of my childhood. When my cannon refused to fire correctly, I learned something new about propulsion. When I soldered my instruments incorrectly, I refined my technique. Had I given up every time an idea failed, I would not have learned from my mistakes, and more importantly, I would not have found success. Even if I never solder again, the lessons I learned from copper fittings are the lessons that will guide me through life.\n\nLosing \"Dive\" remains difficult to accept, yet excitement about the potential in a new game quickly overshadowed my disappointment. Years of faulty designs and unfortunate accidents have taught me to revise my methods, but not my goals, in the face of failure. With a confidence that only arises after realizing that success was just out of reach and finding the audacity to reach further, I set out to make \"Dive 2.0,\" the best game you'll ever play.","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"true","image":797,"date":"2018-11-11T04:57:56.883Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756c-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Think about an academic subject that inspires you.

I was taught math from a very young age which was when my love for math first began. I fell in love with math because it was vast and new. I knew math would be one the hardest to comprehend and I enjoyed the challenge of learning new things. Almost everything in life can be set up and solved in the same formula as a math problem.  Due to math I  built up tolerance and perseverance due to the repetition of solving similar math problems over and over again which helps me stay cool headed in annoying or challenging situations. No matter how simple a problem may seem math has taught me to not take shortcuts because you might move too fast and skip over a step and make a mistake. Math has also taught me how to check over myself in order to avoid mistakes, which ensures me to be as accurate and efficient as possible. I learned how to organize my time in the most efficient way from math. I can figure out how much time a task should take me to complete and which allows me to create and follow a schedule that employs the best use of my time. Math is used everyday in life such as counting money, reading the time, and even checking your phone's battery percentage. Math is more than just adding and subtracting numbers, it is one of the most important tools that I use to tackle some of the hardest problems and situations such as budgeting my money. I view math as a lifestyle especially because there are many types of maths that cover subjects such as statistics which studies chance, means and averages, all of which are important to real everyday life. This lifestyle has taught me how to be critical, hard-working, and tolerant and I would not be anywhere near as successful without math.\n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nI have involved myself with many different educational opportunities in order to prepare myself for college. The first step I took was joining AVID, a program recognized for preparing students for college. I joined AVID in the 7th grade. When I first joined AVID I hated AVID and thought that it was useless and pointless so I quit AVID in the 8th grade. I did so because I did not realize that while AVID felt as if it was not helpful, the work that was given and taught prepared you on how to be a successful College Student. I joined AVID again in the 9th grade because I decided to give it a second chance. In the 9th and 10th grades I still carried the same hateful attitude towards AVID, however, I stuck with AVID. In the 11th grade my attitude towards AVID  started to shift. And now Since being in AVID I have become more organized which was one of my major weaknesses before AVID. Besides being more organized, AVID has also helped guide me on the process of College applications and the FAFSA. Being in an AVID class with other AVID students have connected me with like minded students that push me harder and harder in order to be competitive with those students. My AVID class has bonded and grew closer and now we are a big family where everyone is accepted. Another opportunity to prepare myself for college was The PSAT. I took the PSAT starting my 8th grade year. The PSAT prepared me for the SAT by introducing me to SAT style questions and pointing out my strengths and weaknesses which told me what I needed to study. During my high school career, I have taken multiple Honors and AP classes which challenged and opened my way of thinking critically. Honors and AP classes are more rigorous which adds stress and  are more time consuming. These opportunities, as well as others, have put me on a path which has prepared me for college.\n\nWhat have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  \n\nIn my community I have made a difference in many ways that have created  positive impacts. At first  In my community, I was a boy scout. I was a member of Troop 118 and we underwent many programs to help the community. Being in Boy Scouts teaches morals and ethics to younger and older boys. One specific example of leadership I undertook was at a camp for the younger boy scouts. I volunteered as one of the older boy scouts which help the Scoutmaster watch the kids and make sure they are safe and protected. At school, I joined this program called MESA in which we tutor kids after school. This program helps those who are struggling in the area of math.  I volunteer at the library. Often times I am asked to teach the newer volunteers. In my home, I often run errands for my grandparents because they often don't have the energy to go shopping or to get food. Every Sunday I drive my grandma to church and back home. My grandma is involved with many programs in our church that involve youth and teens so without me driving her she would not be able to perform these actions. When we go grocery shopping, my grandma gives me the list and I go and grab the items off the list in the store. At church every Saturday I volunteer to clean up the church at 8 am. I am also apart of the Junior Usher Board for my church. Every 2nd and 5th Sunday we guide people to their seats and bring fans, programs, and envelopes. When I usher, I help preserve the order of the church and quickly get people into their seats so as to not cause a distraction. When I am not ushering, I help out in Children's Church and teach lessons to those in Children’s Church. These are some of the leadership roles I have had in my house, community, and school.\n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nAs a 17 year old black male one of the problems I have overcame is the stereotype placed on African Americans. As an African American male, society typically places us at the bottom of the list. When I was young I witnessed my family act ghetto which led me to believe as a black male that how I was supposed to behave. Thus in elementary school I fell behind academically because I felt that since I was a black male I wasn’t supposed to care about school. As my grades started to fall my 3rd-grade teacher told me that I wasn’t going to succeed in math and I almost believed her because I believed black men couldn’t succeed in school. In middle school, I started off terribly. I tried to fit in however in return my grades fell as I was barely getting C’s. I fell asleep in classes and I often got sent out of class. Also, I didn’t have a relationship with my teachers and constantly argued with them during class. In 9th grade, things changed because I realized that if I continued down this path that it was leading nowhere. I pushed myself towards success by spending more time on homework and studying. Instead of  C’s I was getting  A’s and a few B’s. This success was addictive and encouraged me to pursue it more. My sophomore year I decided to take advanced classes. I realized the advanced pace was better for me because the other students who weren't serious about school weren’t in my classes and didn’t distract me. I grew connections with my teachers and gained a good reputation amongst teachers. At the end I came to the realization that although I was black male I still could succeed just like anyone else.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"rejected","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":666,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756d-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Whether you've built blanket forts or circuit boards, created slam poetry or mixed media installations, tell us: What have you invented, engineered, produced, or designed? Or what do you hope to?\n\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, I sit in soil pulling crabgrass and borage. I've been a farmer since sophomore year. The farm--managed by my school--is a one-acre plot more accurately described as a garden with chickens.\n\nMy task today is to pick cherry tomatoes, most of which have ripened. I grab a tray from the shed and walk across pathways to the vine. I created these pathways during junior year, shoveling large heaps of wood-chips into a wheelbarrow, then raking these chips onto the pathways between beds. Our two tomato vines stand three feet tall and extend horizontally at least six feet; they are heavy with small red and orange glistening spheres.\n\nI fall into a rhythm, plucking and setting tomatoes in the container, eating several here and there. I recall when I was six, my Mom would send my twin brother and me to the backyard to weed dandelions. We would get distracted and play with our dog or climb the dogwood tree. I recall the awe I felt last week when I harvested a giant sunflower, discovering at least ten potatoes growing in its roots, or when I found a sweet potato the size of a football. I had planted the seed potato pieces last year. I think about jalapenos, how scratches on their skin indicate spiciness level. The satisfaction I felt the first time I ate a piece of food I grew at the farm, a raw green-bean. The pleasure I feel knowing friends and teachers also eat the food I grow; we donate the farm's produce to our school's dining hall and sell it at the weekly farmer's market in the parking lot.\n\nAfter farm, I will work a shift at the Farmer's Market. I will sit, perhaps eating Thai iced-tea-flavored ice cream from another stand, ready to explain where the farm is located, who works it, what we do with unsold food, and, finally, whether the price for a head of lettuce is negotiable (it is). Sometimes, I remember farmers I met during an exchange trip to Yangshuo, China, who were selling pomelos and bamboo shoots. I think about how to me, the difference between one-versus-two dollars for pomelos seems miniscule, but for those farmers, it means a lot. They rely solely on farming to feed their families; I farm for the pleasure of learning what they do out of necessity.\n\nAs I carry my share of tomatoes to the shed - tomatoes I nurtured from seeds into sprouts into fruits – I contemplate how much farm has done for me. I can't sit down to a meal without imagining the plants on my plate as seeds and then sprouts, without wondering about the many hands that brought them to my table. Education, to me, means understanding the hidden processes that make up daily life. Playing with the farm chickens - Pablo, Claude, Vincent, Leonardo - and knowing how the coating around an egg works as a natural preservative makes me appreciate my omelet a tad more. Watching weeds that I pulled from various beds slowly decompose into fertilizer in the compost pile makes me consider the roles carbon and nitrogen cycles play in that process.\n\nAlthough I initially joined farm because I wanted to try something new, I quickly found that the work offers a balance with the intellectual work of the rest of my day. The farm connects education with experience; teaching me to see the application of my classroom learning in a real setting. Being able to see the relevance of what I am studying piques my curiosity. I aspire to maintain this connection between education and experience throughout my life, and will always find ways to contribute to my community, locally or globally. I will look for soil to cultivate, using my learning to see and understand more of the world, whether it be the natural environment or the way people live.","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"","image":1060,"date":"2018-11-11T05:04:01.878Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756e-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"‘Slowly, my mother’s gingham apron began to look more like metal armor.’\n\nWhen it comes to service workers, as a society we completely disregard the manners instilled in us as toddlers.\n\nFor seventeen years, I have awoken to those workers, to clinking silverware rolled in cloth and porcelain plates removed from the oven in preparation for breakfast service. I memorized the geometry of place mats slid on metal trays, coffee cups turned downward, dirtied cloth napkins disposed on dining tables.\n\nI knew never to wear pajamas outside in the public courtyard, and years of shushing from my mother informed me not to speak loudly in front of a guest room window. I grew up in the swaddled cacophony of morning chatter between tourists, professors, and videographers. I grew up conditioned in excessive politeness, fitted for making small talk with strangers.\n\nI grew up in a bed and breakfast, in the sticky thickness of the hospitality industry. And for a very long time I hated it.\n\nI was late to my own fifth birthday party in the park because a guest arrived five hours late without apology. Following a weeklong stay in which someone specially requested her room be cleaned twice a day, not once did she leave a tip for housekeeping. Small-business scammers came for a stop at the inn several times. Guests stained sheets, clogged toilets, locked themselves out of their rooms, and then demanded a discount.\n\nThere exists between service workers and their customers an inherent imbalance of power: We meet sneers with apologies. At the end of their meal, or stay, or drink, we let patrons determine how much effort their server put into their job.\n\nFor most of my life I believed my parents were intense masochists for devoting their existences to the least thankful business I know: the very business that taught me how to discern imbalances of power. Soon I recognized this stem of injustice in all sorts of everyday interactions. I came to understand how latent racism, sexism, classism and ableism structure our society — how tipping was only a synonym for “microaggression.”\n\nI became passionate. Sometimes enraged. I stumbled upon nonprofits, foundations, and political campaigns. I canvassed for Senate candidates, phone-banked for grass-roots action groups, served as a board member for the Women’s Foundation of Southern Arizona, reviewed grant applications for nonprofits and organized events for the nearby children’s hospital.\n\nI devoted my time to the raw grit of helping people, and in the process I fell irrevocably in love with a new type of service: public service. At the same time, I worked midnight Black Friday retail shifts and scraped vomit off linoleum. When I brought home my first W-2, I had never seen my parents so proud.\n\nThe truth, I recently learned, was that not all service is created equal. Seeing guests scream at my parents over a late airport taxi still sickens me even as I spend hours a week as a volunteer. But I was taught all work is noble, especially the work we do for others. Slowly, my mother’s gingham apron began to look more like metal armor. I learned how to worship my parents’ gift for attentive listening, easily hearing the things guests were incapable of asking for — not sugar with their tea, but somebody to talk with while they waited for a conference call. I envied their ability to wear the role of self-assured host like a second skin, capable of tolerating any type of cruelty with a smile.\n\nMost of all, I admired my parents’ continuous trust in humanity to not abuse their help. I realized that learning to serve people looks a lot like learning to trust them.","prompt":"","college":"Columbia University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"Caitlin McCormick","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Arizona","featured":"true","image":530,"date":"2018-11-16T21:30:09.876Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9756f-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"“Biogeochemical. It's a word, I promise!” There are shrieks and shouts in protest and support. Unacceptable insults are thrown, degrees and qualifications are questioned, I think even a piece of my grandmother's famously flakey parantha whizzes past my ear. Everyone is too lazy to take out a dictionary (or even their phones) to look it up, so we just hash it out. And then, I am crowned the victor, a true success in the Merchant household. But it is fleeting, as the small, glossy, plastic tiles, perfectly connected to form my winning word, are snatched out from under me and thrown in a pile with all the disgraced, “unwinning” tiles as we mix for our next game of Bananagrams. It's a similar donnybrook, this time ending with my father arguing that it is okay to use “Rambo” as a word (it totally is not).\n\nWords and communicating have always been of tremendous importance in my life: from silly games like Bananagrams and our road-trip favorite “word game,” to stunted communication between opposing grandparents, each speaking a different Indian language; from trying to understand the cheesemonger behind the counter with a deep southern drawl (I just want some Camembert!), to shaping a script to make people laugh.\n\nWords are moving and changing; they have influence and substance. Words, as I like them, create powerful flavor combinations in a recipe or (hopefully) powerful guffaws from a stand-up joke. They make people laugh with unexpected storylines at an improv show and make people cry with mouthwatering descriptions of crisp green beans lathered with potently salty and delightfully creamy fish sauce vinaigrette at Girl and the Goat. Words create everything I love (except maybe my dog and my mom, but you know, the ideas). The thought that something this small, a word, can combine to create a huge concept, just like each small reaction that makes up different biogeochemical cycles (it's a stretch, I know), is truly amazing.\n\nAfter those aggressive games, my family is quickly able to, in the words of a fellow Nashvillian, “shake it off.” We gather around bowls of my grandmother's steaming rice and cumin-spiced chicken (food is always, always at the center of it), and enjoy.

To resolve the matter, please choose one of the following:\n\nRock, paper, or scissors.\n\nYou will be notified of our decision shortly.\n\nResponse:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Wait... paper beats rock? Since when has a sheet of loose leaf paper ever defeated a solid block of granite? Do we assume that the paper wraps around the rock, smothering the rock into submission? When exposed to paper, is rock somehow immobilized, unable to fulfill its primary function of smashing scissors?  What constitutes defeat between two inanimate objects?\n\nMaybe it’s all a metaphor for larger ideals. Perhaps paper is rooted in the symbolism of diplomacy while rock suggests coercion. But does compromise necessarily trump brute force? And where do scissors lie in this chain of symbolism?\n\nI guess the reasoning behind this game has a lot to do with context. If we are to rationalize the logic behind this game, we have to assume some kind of narrative, an instance in which paper might beat rock. Unfortunately, I can’t argue for a convincing one.\n\nAs with rock-paper-scissors, we often cut our narratives short to make the games we play easier, ignoring the intricate assumptions that keep the game running smoothly. Like rock-paper-scissors, we tend to accept something not because it’s true, but because it’s the convenient route to getting things accomplished. We accept incomplete narratives when they serve us well, overlooking their logical gaps. Other times, we exaggerate even the smallest defects and uncertainties in narratives we don’t want to deal with. In a world where we know very little about the nature of “Truth,” it’s very easy—and tempting—to construct stories around truth claims that unfairly legitimize or delegitimize the games we play.\n\nOr maybe I’m just making a big deal out of nothing…\n\nFine. I’ll stop with the semantics and play your game.\n\nBut who actually wants to play a game of rock-paper-scissors?  After all, isn’t it just a game of random luck, requiring zero skill and talent? That’s no way to admit someone!\n\nWrong.\n\nStudies have shown that there are winning strategies to rock-paper-scissors by making critical assumptions about those we play against before the round has even started. Douglas Walker, host of the Rock-Paper-Scissors World Championships (didn’t know that existed either), conducted research indicating that males will use rock as their opening move 50% of the time, a gesture Walker believes is due to rock’s symbolic association with strength and force. In this sense, the seemingly innocuous game of rock-paper-scissors has revealed something quite discomforting about gender-related dispositions in our society. Why did so many males think that brute strength was the best option? If social standards have subliminally influenced the way males and females play rock-paper-scissors, than what is to prevent such biases from skewing more important decisions? Should your decision to go to war or to feed the hungry depend on your gender, race, creed, etc?\n\nPerhaps the narratives I spoke of earlier, the stories I mistakenly labeled as “semantics,” carry real weight in our everyday decisions. In the case of Walker’s study, men unconsciously created an irrational narrative around an abstract rock. We all tell slightly different narratives when we independently consider notions ranging from rocks to war to existence. It is ultimately the unconscious gaps in these narratives that are responsible for many of the man-made problems this world faces. In order for the “life of the mind” to be a worthwhile endeavor, we must challenge the unconscious narratives we attach to the larger games we play—the truths we tell (or don’t tell), the lessons we learn (or haven’t really learned), the people we meet (or haven’t truly met).\n\nBut even after all of this, we still don’t completely understand the narrative behind rock-paper-scissors.  \n\nI guess it all comes down to who actually made this silly game in the first place... I’d like to think it was some snotty 3rd grader, but then again, that’s just another incomplete narrative.","prompt":"","college":"University of Chicago","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Illinois","featured":"","image":874,"date":"2018-11-11T06:17:58.441Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97571-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.\n\nThroughout my years in both middle school and high school, I have taken up many leadership positions. From several positions in Associated Student Body to captain of my volleyball team. However, I think the one positions that has had the biggest impact on others is my current position as Interclub Council Representative for my Middle College program. Not only do I play a key role in keeping the program updated about the happenings around the college I also serve a key role in planning for the whole program. It is one of my jobs to help build a schedule for the programs 200+ students. This includes prom planning, fundraising, events the college is putting on that we are participating in, yearbook, senior banquet, and more. By being in this position I have the expectation to make sure that this year will be an unforgettable one for the seniors and a pathway for the juniors. Now when it comes to the actual meetings I go to for the college that is a slightly different matter. It is actually like being your high school’s student representative for school board meetings but instead you are meeting the college’s board. During these meetings I report what is happening with my program and then find out what is happening throughout the college. This helps since then all of the students will know what to look forward to and us officers will be able to adequately plan for it. Taking part in this also lets me know how to make sure my program gets involved in these events.\n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nAn educational boundary I overcame was dealing with a D grade for Spanish 1 in my sophomore year. Since I took the class as a night school option it was not just students taking Spanish 1 it was for Spanish 1, 2, and 3; this lead to me having a hard time keeping up and leaving me ultimately confused. However, regardless of the reason I do not deal with failure very nicely and this grade stressed me out to the max. I quickly had to rearrange my previous educational plans in order to make up for this terrible grade. I had decided to take both semesters of Spanish for summer school in order to take Spanish 2 when I started my junior year. This changed however when I was accepted into my district’s Middle College program at Moreno Valley Community College. I was not able to make it up over that summer but I did take it in that fall semester. Even though it was a college class it was easy to follow and allowed me to actually learn about the language itself. Continuing with the fact that it was a college class, in order to make up for the fact that is was still in high school I worked even harder than usual. Constantly studied both the upcoming material and what we were learning at that time. I also made it my habit to listen to Spanish music while working so that I was surrounded by the language. Thanks to all that I was able to secure myself an A in one of my first college classes.\n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nThe most significant challenge I have faced was dealing with my inferiority complex when it came to my older brother and younger sister. Growing up I would always hear how naturally smart they were when it came to things like GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) testing and grades. I, being the only one who did not test into GATE, felt that I was not as good as them when it came to school. However, since I did not like this way of thought I worked for admittance into the program and was allowed to join the GATE program as long as I kept my grades up. So growing up I would work twice as much as they would so that I would never be seen as below them. This included making sure I would get the same teachers that my older brother had so that I knew I would have the same amount of coursework. By doing this I created opportunities to excel myself and not allow for slacking off. This moved me from just barely being allowed into GATE to a hard worker who deserved to be there. I now aim for the best for everything I do in school. This includes sports, grades, clubs, leadership positions, and many more. If I believe it will be good for my future I want to take part in. Now this has helped me out, but there were some downsides to this way of thinking. I did not like my younger sister very much growing up because I would always feel that she was better than me because of her natural born advantage, being that she was considered smarter than me. So in order to become a better person for both of our sakes I switched up my way of thinking and worked hard on becoming a better person altogether. Thus, overcoming this complex of mine has reduced my worry of what would become of my relationship with my siblings. \n\nThink about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.\n\nWhen it comes to my favorite subject in school I find it hard to settle on just one. I absolutely love anything and everything that has to do with the science. Chemistry, biology, psychology, earth science, etc. all of it is connected and opens a door to something new. Every time I learn something new from one subject I quickly try to see how it relates to another. However, if I had to choose one it would be chemistry. Which relates to my intended field of study of chemical engineering. Because I loved learning so much concerning science I knew I wanted to do something that kept me close to it. I finally decided I wanted to study chemical engineering during my sophomore year when I took chemistry for the first time. Day after day it continued to call on my attention and I explored further into the world of chemistry. As I did learn more I realized how much I loved it and wanted to continue to surround myself with it. Therefore, I made the decision to dedicate my major to chemistry. However, I was not sure what field of chemistry at first it took me some time to decide. I finally did decide when I realized that I would be able to mix together chemistry and one of my most outstanding qualities: improving things that already exist. That being said the impact chemistry has had on me and will continue to have on me will be one that will last a lifetime.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"rejected","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":898,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.270Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97572-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"‘My Dell hid my privilege and my Mac hid my financial need’\n\nThe most exciting part was the laptop.\n\nMy mom grabbed the thick envelope out of my hands and read off the amenities associated with the Tang Scholarship to Phillips Academy: full tuition for all four years, a free summer trip, $20 a week for me to spend on all the Cheetos and nail polish my heart desired, and finally, a free laptop.\n\nI had never had a computer of my own before, and to me the prospect symbolized a world of new possibilities. I was the only student from my public middle school I knew to ever go to an elite boarding school, and it felt like being invited into a selective club. My first week at Andover, dazed by its glamour and newness, I fought my way to the financial aid office to pick up the laptop; I sent my mom a photo of me grinning and clutching the cardboard box. Back in my dorm room, I pulled out my prize, a heavy but functional Dell, and marveled at its sleek edges, its astonishing speed.\n\nBut the love story of my laptop came clamoring to a halt. In the library, as I stumbled to negotiate a space to fit in, I watched my friends each pull out a MacBook. Each was paper-thin and seemingly weightless. And mine, heavy enough to hurt my back and constantly sighing like a tired dog, was distinctly out of place. My laptop, which I had thought was my ticket to the elite world of Andover, actually gave me away as the outsider I was.\n\nFor a long time, this was the crux of my Andover experience: always an outsider. When I hung out with wealthier friends, I was disoriented by how different their lives were from mine. While they spent summers in Prague or Paris, I spent mine mining the constellation of thrift stores around New Haven. The gap between full-scholarship and full-pay felt insurmountable.\n\nBut I also felt like an outsider going to meetings for the full-scholarship affinity group. My parents attended college and grew up wealthier than I did, giving me cultural capital many of my full-scholarship friends never had access to. Moreover, I’m white and could afford occasional concert tickets or sparkly earrings. The laptop, carried by all full-scholarship students and coded with hidden meanings, pivoted my friends’ understandings of me. At home, I grew up middle class, then became the privileged prep school girl. But at Andover, suddenly, I was poor. Trying to reconcile these conflicting identities, I realized how complex and mutable class is. My class is connected to my parents’ income, but it’s also rooted in cultural knowledge and objects that are charged with greater meaning.\n\nWhich brings me back to the laptop: in the middle of my senior fall, my exhausted Dell broke and I couldn’t afford another. When I managed to borrow a slim Mac from my school, I felt the walls around me reorient. I hoped that now I wouldn’t have to think about the electric web of privilege and power every time I sent an email. Instead, I felt a new anxiety: I worried when I sat in the magnificent dining hall with my beautiful computer that I had lost an important part of my identity.\n\nWhen I started at Andover, these constant dueling tensions felt like a trap: like I would never be comfortable anywhere. (The school sensed it too, and all full-financial aid students now receive MacBooks.) But maybe it’s the opposite of a trap. Maybe I’m culturally ambidextrous, as comfortable introducing a speaker on the stage of Andover’s century-old chapel as getting my nose pierced in a tattoo parlor in New Haven. My hyperawareness of how my Dell hid my privilege and how my Mac hid my financial need pushed me to be aware of what complicated stories were hiding behind my classmates’ seemingly simple facades. I am a full-scholarship student who benefits from cultural, socioeconomic and racial privilege: my story isn’t easy, but it’s still mine.","prompt":"","college":"Columbia University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"Zöe Sottile","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"","image":223,"date":"2018-11-16T21:37:21.927Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97573-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Every Saturday morning, I’d awaken to the smell of crushed garlic and piquant pepper.

Though her withered hands no longer displayed the swiftness and precision they once did, her face showed the aged rigor of a professional. For the first time in years, the smell of garlic filled the air and the rattling of the silver bowl resonated throughout the house.\n\nThat night, we ate kimchi. It wasn’t perfect; the cabbages were clumsily cut and the garlic was a little too strong. But kimchi had never tasted better. I still remember my grandma putting a piece in my mouth and saying, “Here, Dong Jin. Try it, my boy.”\n\nSeeing grandma again this summer, that moment of clarity seemed ephemeral. Her disheveled hair and expressionless face told of the aggressive development of her illness.\n\nBut holding her hands, looking into her eyes, I could still smell that garlic. The moments of Saturday mornings remain ingrained in my mind. Grandma was an artist who painted the cabbages with strokes of red pepper. Like the sweet taste of kimchi, I hope to capture those memories in my keystrokes as I type away these words.\n\nA piece of writing is more than just a piece of writing. It evokes. It inspires. It captures what time takes away.\n\nMy grandma used to say: “Tigers leave furs when they die, humans leave their names.” Her legacy was the smell of garlic that lingered around my house. Mine will be these words.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":67,"date":"2018-11-11T05:32:13.079Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97574-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Life from Seven Feet Up\n\nWalking down a busy street, I see the quick glances and turned heads. The murmurs and giggles trickle toward me. I try to ignore the buzz, interspersed with, “Oh my God!” and the occasional, “Damn!” Then, a complete stranger asks for a picture, so I stand with people foreign to me and politely smile and laugh. After the click of the camera, they go on their way. Sometimes I wish I weren’t so tall. Maybe then I could take a friend to a movie and just blend into the crowd.\n\nAttention from strangers is nothing new to me. Questions about my height dominate almost every public interaction. My friends say my height is just a physical quality and not a personality trait. However, when I reflect on my life, I realize that my height has shaped my character in many ways and has helped to define the person I am.\n\nI learned how to be comfortable in my own skin. If I had the introverted personality my older brother had in high school, I’d probably be overwhelmed by the constant public attention. Even as a young child, parents at the sidelines of my baseball games, as well as the umpire, would, in front of all my teammates, demand by birth certificate to prove my age. I grew acquainted early on with the fact that I am abnormally tall and stick out about the crowd. It’s just the way it is. Being self-conscious about it would be paralyzing.\n\nI learned how to be kind. When I was younger, some parents in my neighborhood deemed me a bully because I was so much larger than children my age. I had to be extra welcoming and gentle simply to play with other children. Of course, now my coaches wish I weren’t quite so kind on the basketball court.\n\nEven More Essays That WorkdI learned humility. At 7 feet tall, everyone expects me to be an amazing basketball player. They come expecting to see Dirk Nowitzki, and instead they might see a performance more like Will Ferrell in Semi-Pro. I have learned to be humble and to work even harder than my peers to meet their (and my) expectations.\n\nI developed a sense of lightheartedness. When people playfully make fun of my height, I laugh at myself too. On my first day of high school, a girl dropped her books in a busy hallway. I crouched down to her level and gathered some of her notebooks. As we both stood up, her eyes widened as I kept rising over her. Dumbfounded, she dropped her books again. Embarrassed, we both laughed and picked up the books a second time.\n\nAll of these lessons have defined me. People unfamiliar to me have always wanted to engage me in lengthy conversations, so I have had to become comfortable interacting with all kinds of people. Looking back, I realize that through years of such encounters, I have become a confident, articulate person. Being a 7-footer is both a blessing and a curse, but in the end, accepting who you are is the first step to happiness.","prompt":"","college":"Hamillton College","year":2008,"status":"accepted","author":"Alexander Wear","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Washington","featured":"","image":411,"date":"2018-11-17T20:28:17.048Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97575-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? \n\nCaptivating an audience has always been my strong suit,  I definitely am able to herd in people’s attention and also provide them the ears needed to later broadcast their words. Public speaking is something I’ve been comfortable with since I was twelve, I'm confident but not so brazen that I'm unapproachable. It’s a strong factor for me as a leader because I feel like it's my best connection to my peers; it establishes a mutual respect. Public speaking has been a skill I've exercised in many situations, from being elected for secretary of Spanish Honor Society to speaking in familiar circles such as my youth group. I’ve held positions as simple as a representative and as difficult as president, but no matter the title I find that eloquence comes in use each time.\n\n This year I studied rhetoric in AP English Language. The class has significantly helped me with making sure that whenever I speak, I do so collectively and firmly. Strengthening my voice has tremendously enhanced my leadership skills, so much that I've felt confident enough to take the challenge of restarting a dying club. Speaking out makes me feel empowered and helps me to realize how significant I can be to the world. I know there is power in words and not just my own. That's why I am prepared to revive the Black Student Union on my campus this coming year; it is a club that I owe much to. It was a place of opportunity and nurturing for me and my desire is to give back ensure it lives for the students to come. I want to leave something behind for the future that expands students’ capacity. As a senior I'm going to foster a place where others can come to learn, speak, and spread the same empowerment I feel, because looking back on my high school career, public speaking was the forte that solidified the leader I am today. \n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nAn educational barrier I have faced is financial restriction. I come from a family of seven children, a dollar holds heavy value in my home. Both my father and mother lack the sufficient resources needed to support many activities. During high school all the pamphlets and college plans encouraged students to visit and experience the campuses they were considering.  All of the Californian universities I had interest in were at least two hours away; it wasn’t really in my parents’ capabilities to simply pick up and take me to visit them. But despite this, I wouldn't let myself be hindered. I sought out an alternative, any way for me to get what I needed.\n\n    I soon learned about Project BEST (Black Excellence in Scholarship and Teaching) in my school and joined. I later came to know that the group focused on touring California’s campuses and exposing student to the many options for college. My freshman and sophomore year I devoted myself and visited five universities, Stanford and four UC campuses included. Being in that environment was a splash of cold water in my face. I was shaken — and even more — awoken. These were some of the best some schools, harboring some of the very best minds, and they were within my reach. I realized It wasn't impossible. I'd found a way to get myself this far. I told myself if I really wanted it, money wasn't going to stop me; I'd get myself farther. \n\nIt was an amazing opportunity that I didn’t hesitate to take advantage of, and that exposure has made me aware of my options and what universities are best for me and my goals. Participating in the Experience Berkeley itself this summer was a incomparable privilege that I was able to use and I am completely grateful for the help it has given me. College is the next milestone of my life! I have been and will continue doing all I can to ensure that I give myself the best chance possible to pursue my passions.\n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nIn my seventeen years the greatest challenge I have ever faced was adjusting to the drastic changes that struck my life when I was twelve. My entire life up to that year I hadn’t known there was much of a world past my small town because I became so accustomed to my surroundings. It was predominantly Mexican-immigrant and predominantly low income. That summer of 2010 my parents had divorced; their marriage had been under financial stress among other things. I had expected my life to change as far as my parents separating, but I hadn't expected to find myself in Bakersfield at a whole new school and experiencing my first case of culture shock. It seemed as though my whole life had been uprooted and I was forced to adjust to it. I loved my school and life in Wasco, but coming to Bakersfield threw me from a pond to a lake, and I wasn't the big fish anymore. For the first time in my life I wasn't able to give basic effort, I didn't have the reassurance that I’d still be number one. If I wanted to be distinguished here, I'd have to really work. It was this moment I learned that if you don't hustle and commit to do something, someone else will sweep past and do it for you. \n\nThe academics were better here and the people another economic class. I realized that I wanted to succeed farther than my parents and I wanted to be just as smart and driven as the kids at my school. Being shown a grander life encouraged me to stay motivated, to stay progressing. That year I received national honor and recognition for my academic success in the United States Achievement Academy. I had thought to myself, “these kids are going to take off into the big world and I can't let them leave me behind.” \n\nThe challenge of change affected my life from that day on. I am still driving forward with the same competitiveness, the same determination to set my goals and reach them because I promised to be just as much a part of the world as anyone.\n\nBeyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?\n\nI have a burning desire to change the condition of the world around me and I believe it's what sets me apart from any other person. I am passionate about increasing my knowledge of cultures and the developments of peoples and countries. Transitioning to my college I know now I'd like to use the UCs' courses to expand my knowledge as a global citizen and grant me the skills I need to make an active difference. It is ultimately my goal to be a woman who aids poverty-stricken countries through medicine. The passion I feel for this has given me a drive like no other. I've seen poverty and I know I want to make a difference.\n\nMy spring break of sophomore year I had the opportunity to visit my grandfather for the first time since he had been deported a year prior. I lived for a week in poor Mexico and I was astounded. Parents worked all day and children cared for their siblings; all they were doing was surviving day by day. In America kids have iPads, in Mexico they have worn shoes and their imaginations. I played outside, I remembered what it was to be left to my own devices — to be unprivileged. I purchased candy for less than a dollar, so much less that I was able to buy for all of the children who had been playing “en la calle”. The people are poor and growing poorer; I came to find my own grandfather couldn’t afford proper surgery. It was staggering to realize conditions in other countries were far worse than this. The people here at least had drinkable water, but there are countries lacking even that. \n\nBeing Afro-Latina, I have and will face adversity, but nothing will stand in the way of my passion. I've been so blessed it's time I do unto others. I need to be the change and I know with the University of California I will garner the knowledge, experience, and confidence to do so. I cannot change the world on my own, but I am determined to be a step in that direction. I'm going to be the change — that's what sets me apart.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":194,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97576-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"As you reflect on life thus far, what has someone said, written, or expressed in some fashion that is especially meaningful to you. Why?\n\nAccording to Mother Teresa, “If you judge someone, you have no time to love them.” I first saw this quote when it was posted on my sixth-grade classroom wall, and I hated it. Rather, I hated Mother Teresa’s intention, but I knew that the quote’s veracity was inarguable. I felt that it was better to judge people so as not to have to love them, because some people don’t deserve a chance. Judgments are shields, and mine was impenetrable.\n\nLaura was my dad’s first girlfriend after my parents’ divorce. The first three years of our relationship were characterized solely by my hatred toward her, manifested in my hurting her, each moment hurting myself twice as much. From the moment I laid eyes on her, she was the object of my unabated hatred, not because of anything she had ever done, but because of everything she represented. I judged her to be a heartless, soulless, two-dimensional figure: she was a representation of my loneliness and pain. I left whenever she entered a room, I slammed car doors in her face. Over those three years, I took pride in the fact that I had not spoken a word to her or made eye contact with her. I treated Laura with such resentment and anger because my hate was my protection, my shield. I, accustomed to viewing her as the embodiment of my pain, was afraid to let go of the anger and hate, afraid to love the person who allowed me to hold onto my anger, afraid that if I gave her a chance, I might love her.\n\nFor those three years, Laura didn’t hate me; she understood me. She understood my anger and my confusion, and Laura put her faith in me, although she had every reason not to. To her, I was essentially a good person, just confused and scared; trying to do her best, but just not able to get a hold of herself. She saw me as I wished I could see myself.\n\nNone of this became clear to me overnight. Instead, over the next two years, the one-dimensional image of her in my mind began to take the shape of a person. As I let go of my hatred, I gave her a chance. She became a woman who, like me, loves Ally McBeal and drinks a lot of coffee; who, unlike me, buys things advertised on infomercials.\n\nThree weeks ago, I saw that same Mother Teresa quote again, but this time I smiled. Laura never gave up on me, and the chance she gave me to like her was a chance that changed my life. Because of this, I know the value of a chance, of having faith in a person, of seeing others as they wish they could see themselves. I’m glad I have a lot of time left, because I definitely have a lot of chances left to give, a lot of people left to love.","prompt":"","college":"Stanford University","year":2006,"status":"accepted","author":"Allison Dencker","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":640,"date":"2018-11-16T23:20:33.936Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97577-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Everyone belongs to many different communities and/or groups defined by (among other things) shared geography, religion, ethnicity, income, cuisine, interest, race, ideology, or intellectual heritage.

On a desk in the left corner, a framed picture of an Asian family is beaming their smiles, buried among US history textbooks and The Great Gatsby. A Korean ballad streams from a pair of tiny computer speakers. Pamphlets of American colleges are scattered about on the floor. A cold December wind wafts a strange infusion of ramen and leftover pizza. On the wall in the far back, a Korean flag hangs besides a Led Zeppelin poster.\n\nDo I consider myself Korean or American?\n\nA few years back, I would have replied: “Neither.” The frustrating moments of miscommunication, the stifling homesickness, and the impossible dilemma of deciding between the Korean or American table in the dining hall, all fueled my identity crisis.\n\nStanding in the “Foreign Passports” section at JFK, I have always felt out of place.

I prefer to describe Northville as reckless.\n\nThe more enterprising students of Northville High School specialize in the selling of three goods: marijuana, Adderall and test answers, all goods many of my peers don’t think twice about using. We’re from Northville. Most of us know nothing of consequences or responsibility for our actions, because our fathers can cover for us with cash and connections. We’ve been raised in such privilege that we feel enabled to say and do whatever we want, thoughtlessly.\n\nSeveral years back, when the rap aesthetic was particularly prominent, most of the males came to school in ill-fitting jeans that sagged below their designer boxers, sporting T-shirts and necklaces that likely cost more than the weekly income for the average person, in imitation of their favorite rapper. They carried themselves like Eminem and spewed out Jay Z verses about being raised in extreme urban poverty and racism, before parroting their parents’ views on the “communist” welfare programs.\n\nDerogatory terms for gays, the disabled and people of color are shouted in the hallway, right over the heads of people to whom those refer. From experience, I can certify that the administration does little besides halfheartedly admonish reported bullies and send them on their way to continue their reign of terror.\n\nTo my chagrin, I have occasionally fallen into a similar mindset. I once asked a friend, whose family I knew was struggling, what AP tests she planned to take. She replied that her family couldn’t afford any. I had forgotten how bad her circumstances were and had asked my question without thinking. I found myself victim to the disease that infiltrates Northville, the same carelessness I despise. Northville’s gilded bubble caused me to forget that some don’t have the luxury of affording even the reduced price of standardized tests.\n\nAside from being potentially harmful, this recklessness creates a sense of emptiness for me. Superficial, materialistic and shallow, we’re all too busy going on to the next thing, focusing on getting an A and not about learning the material, and getting our rib into a conversation without listening to what was actually said. Our sole aim is to keep moving. Where, how and at what cost are irrelevant questions to us, and thus we manage to remove all trace of purpose from our actions.\n\nMy most prominent goal has always been to leave Northville behind, to find a world in which people act consciously, aware that their actions affect others, and choose to delve deeper by asking questions and seeking legitimate answers that may differ from their limited understanding. In the meantime, I aspire to prepare myself by being more thoughtful, informed and, most of all, careful.","prompt":"","college":"Stanford University","year":2015,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"","image":769,"date":"2018-11-11T06:41:56.721Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97579-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Psst! I have a confession to make. I have a shoe fetish. Everyone around me seems to underestimate the statement a simple pair of shoes can make. To me, though, the shoes I wear are not merely covering for the two feet on which I tread, but a reflection of who I am.\n\nSo, who am I? Why don’t you look down at my feet? I could be wearing my high-platform sandals—my confidence, my leadership, my I-want-to-be-tall-even-though-I’m-not shoes. My toes are free in these sandals and wiggle at will. Much like my feet in my sandals, I don’t like being restricted. I have boundless energy that must not go to waste! Or maybe I’m wearing my furry pink pig slippers. I wear these on crisp winter nights when I’m home spending time with my family. My slippers are my comforting side. I can wear them and listen to a friend cry for hours on end. My favorite pair of shoes, however, are my bright red Dr. Martens. They’re my individuality, my enthusiasm, my laughter, my love of risk-taking. No one else I know has them. When I don’t feel like drawing attention to my feet or, for that matter, to myself, I wear my gym shoes. These sneakers render me indistinguishable from others and thereby allow me to be independent. I wear them running, riding my bicycle alone through the trails surrounded by signs of autumn, and even when I go to a museum and stand, transfixed by a single photograph. My hiking boots typify my love of adventure and being outdoors. Broken in and molded to the shape of my foot, when wearing them I feel in touch with my surroundings.\n\nDuring college I intend to add to my collection yet another closet full of colorful clodhoppers. For each aspect of my personality I discover or enhance through my college experiences, I will find a pair of shoes to reflect it. Perhaps a pair of Naot sandals for my Jewish Studies class or one black shoe and one white when learning about the Chinese culture and its belief in yin and yang. As I get to know myself and my goals grow nearer, my collection will expand.\n\nBy the time I’m through with college, I will be ready to take a big step. Ready for a change, I believe I’ll need only one pair after this point. The shoes will be both fun and comfortable; I’ll be able to wear them when I am at work and when I return home. A combination of every shoe in my collection, these shoes will embody each aspect of my personality in a single footstep. No longer will I have a separate pair for each quirk and quality. This one pair will say it all. It will be evidence of my self-awareness and maturity. Sure, I’ll keep a few favorites for old times’ sake. I’ll lace up the old red shoes when I’m feeling rambunctious, when I feel that familiar, teenage surge of energy and remember the girl who wore them: a young girl with the potential to grow.\n\nI am entering college a naïve, teenage bundle of energy, independence, and motivation. My closet full of shoes mirrors my array of interests, and at the same time my difficulty in choosing a single interest that will satisfy me for the rest of my life. I want to leave college with direction, having pinpointed a single interest to pursue that will add texture and meaning to my life.\n\nSo there you have it.

I arrived first and took a seat, facing the door. Behind me the TV showed highlights from the Mexican Soccer League. I felt nervous and unsure. How would I be received by a famous revolutionary—an upper-middle-class American kid asking a communist hero questions? Then I spotted him in the doorway and my breath caught in my throat. In his overcoat, beard, and beret he looked as if he had just stepped out from one of Batista’s “wanted” posters. I rose to greet Ernesto “Che” Guevara and we shook hands. At the counter we ordered: he, enchiladas verdes and a beer, and I, a burrito and two “limonadas.” The food arrived and we began to talk.\n\nI told him that I felt honored to meet him and that I admired him greatly for his approach to life. He saw the plight of Latin America’s poor and tried to improve their state but went about it on his own terms, not on society’s. He waved away my praise with his food-laden fork, responding that he was happy to be here and that it was nice to get out once in a while. Our conversation moved on to his youth and the early choices that set him on his path to becoming a revolutionary.\n\nI have always been curious about what drove Che Guevara to abandon his medical career and take military action to improve the lot of Cuba’s poor. Why did he feel that he could do more for the poor as a guerilla leader than as a doctor? His answer was concise: as he came of age he began to realize that the political situation in Latin America had become unacceptable and had to be changed as soon as possible. He saw in many nations “tin-pot” dictators reliant on the United States for economic and military aid, ruining their nations and destroying the lives of their people. He felt morally obligated to change this situation and believed he could help more people in a more direct manner as a warrior rather than as a doctor. Next I asked why he chose communism as the means of achieving his goals.\n\nHe replied that communism was merely a means to an end. That end was a Central and South America run by its citizens, free of foreign intervention. In his opinion communism was the best way to realize this dream. I agreed that a nation should be run by and for its citizens, but I hesitated to agree wholeheartedly. I was concerned by his exclusive emphasis on Latin Americans. His description, as I interpreted it, implied a nationalism and exclusion of others, most notably Americans. I felt that this focus on “Latin Americanism” could easily lead to the outbreak of war in the region.\n\nMoving from Cuba’s past to its present, I asked him if he sees the revolution begun in 1959 as successful. Has Cuba fulfilled his vision for it? Che Guevara sighed and gathered his thoughts for a moment. Then, speaking slowly, he said that he didn’t think that Cuba had fulfilled the revolution because the revolution never spread beyond Cuba, as he had hoped it would. The revolution did not spread, he reasoned, because of the success of the United States in propping up corrupt dictators and the inability of Cuba to build a viable economy upon which to support the export of revolution. I countered his negative view, pointing out that today many of the Latin American countries once under totalitarian rule are democratic, partly due to the spirit of reform he exemplified nearly half a century before. He acknowledged the progress made but remained adamant that the nations were still not free of foreign intervention.\n\nAt this point one of the Mexican teams on TV scored a goal, and we broke off our political conversation to talk about soccer. Though I know about European soccer, I know next to nothing about the South American game. He enlightened me, although he admitted his information was a bit out of date. I asked him if he had seen the great Argentinean striker Alfredo Di Stefano play, but Che Guevara said he couldn’t remember.\n\nIn light of the events of September 11th, I asked about violence. In his view, when is it justified? Che Guevara responded by saying that violence is justified because those who hold power unjustly respond only to violence as a tool for change. They will not willingly relinquish power unless shown that the people will overwhelm and destroy them. I disagreed vociferously, citing Peru and Guatemala as places where violence had been used and failed, only further impoverishing the nations. Che Guevara explained these failures as the inevitable outcome of the revolutionaries losing sight of their original moral goals. Reflecting upon his answers so far, I realized that I had lost some of my admiration for him. By taking up the standard of Pan-American unity, I felt he lost some of his humanity that led me to identify so closely with him. To me he had become more of a symbol than an actual person.\n\nAt this point I realized that I had to be home soon and thanked him profusely for his generosity in answering my questions. As we walked toward the door, I noticed that I had left my hat on the table. I turned back to retrieve it, but by the time I had reached the doorway again, Che Guevara had disappeared into the mix of the afternoon sunlight and shadow cast by the “El” tracks, as mysteriously as he had come.","prompt":"","college":"Carleton College","year":2006,"status":"accepted","author":"Ted Mullin","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":58,"date":"2018-11-17T00:08:01.495Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9757b-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  \n\nI applied to be captain of my colorguard team my junior year. I was awarded the position, and with that, the responsibility of running an entire class period by myself. Coaches weren’t present during the school day, which left me to find a way to tame a rambunctious group of fourteen year olds. In my first attempts of running the class, my team members began to resent me. Too much of our time was wasted by talking and refusing to dress out in a timely manner. The team members that were dedicated were thrown off by this group of freshmen who were loud and disrespectful. I was open to constructive criticism, but when I asked them how they felt I was failing as a captain, no one had an answer for me. Complaining to my coach that the team was disrespectful only prompted her response that I will not get respect if I do not demand it. \n\nWell that’s what I had to do. I told the more mature team members that I was depending on them to be role models and not encourage disruptive behavior. I had to take phones away and move talkative members, but I also made time to talk to everyone and create moments for the team to bond. At the end of every major season I hosted a party at my house for the team in which we livestreamed finals and enjoyed each other's company. By combining a sense of communication along with being more assertive, I was able to construct a productive class period. They dressed out, I led stretches and exercises, and cleaned parts of our show until the period was over. Most importantly, I emphasized working alongside them. I took every repetition they did, and I opened myself to the same criticism I subjected them to. Our coaches noticed the improvement and even other team members thanked me for pushing them to be better. Today, we are a world class team.

Describe how you express your creative side.  \n\nMy greatest passion in life is dancing. I began dancing when I was four years old, but I did not truly love it until I entered high school. My school was a lonely place freshman year, and along with many other fourteen year olds, I struggled to define myself. Even as I began to practice with my color guard team, I felt the pressure of needing to be a better dancer. Then I had my first performance. Words cannot describe the freedom and certainty I felt as I danced and spun my flag across the football field. Nothing mattered to me but the moves I made in that moment. \n\nThrough my high school career I have been asked to create rifle choreography for our first JV Color Guard team, a visual for the Bulldog Brigade’s showing of Cirque Du Soleil, and be an assistant choreographer to the Bulldog Theater Company’s production of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. The school musical was the longest and most daunting task, because I was responsible for dance work that would soon be performed for a paying audience. In the beginning I found myself constantly looking to the head choreographer to validate my work. However, as I began to understand the show and the characters, I saw how movement would bring each piece of music to life. A week before opening night, the ballet number of the show had been untouched by the head choreographer, so I choreographed it myself. I taught  turns, jumps, and a lift to the two actors in the number. They rehearsed with me for hours to polish every move. I watched them take my work and embed it into a story, and it was awe inspiring to see my passion on stage. Most rewardingly, the audience reacted with the laughs and sighs of adoration I had hoped to provoke from them. Then I understood that dance is not only where I gained the confidence to express my ideas. It’s a form of communication that requires empathy, a skill I can use in every aspect of life and profession. \n\nWhat would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? \n\nMy forearms were black and blue, my entire body was sore, and I had never been more determined in my life. My sophomore year, I was finally given the chance to be on my color guard saber line. This was my first time spinning a weapon, and I felt that I had to prove my right to have this spot on the team. During my first week on this new piece of equipment, I was told I had to toss a five. Every practice I would work on tossing. I’d watch the saber spin one, two, three, four, five times in the air for it to only come back down to strike my wrist. I’d try again, tossing the saber up, watching it spin with my hands stretched out to hopefully catch it. It loudly crashed on the gym floor. I felt embarrassed. I wanted so badly to not disappoint my coaches. The point of me auditioning was to improve, to show that I can move up in this sport. Fortunately, there was one senior on my team that wanted me to succeed almost as much as I did. She tossed with me, critiqued me, and always gave me words of encouragement. I tried again to fulfill this one request from my coach. The saber spun in the air one, two, three, four, five times, and it landed perfectly in my hopeful, outstretched hands. From then on, I only improved. Once I understood how to manipulate the equipment in the most basic ways, I was able to be taught any choreography that included this piece of equipment. My arms returned to a healthy color and I showed my coaches what I was capable of. I performed basic tosses, tosses I turned under, and even just danced with my saber. I say spinning saber is my greatest skill not only because I can now do it almost flawlessly, but because I gained this skill through determination and dedication. It reminds me that I’ve improved from the person I was just months before picking up a saber for the first time. \n\n Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nI will never dread going to the dentist again. However, dread was exactly what I felt the last time I had an eight am dentist appointment. The last thing I expected was for my check up to result in an educational opportunity. My mother had been bragging about my inclination towards medicine to my dentist, and as I blushed and went to excuse my mother from the doctor, he asked if I would like to shadow him. He had a crown placement coming up, and thought I could benefit from seeing how dentistry worked. I thanked him repeatedly in my flustered excitement, and then thanked my mother for speaking so fondly of me.\n\nMy first day in the cold dentist office was a four hour shift with Dr.Ismailyan. I had hope that by shadowing him I would further understand the true life and responsibility of a doctor. During my time there, I  was taught the difference between porcelain and silver fillings, saw how a crown was made and placed, and was introduced to the journey that is creating a well adjusted pair of dentures. I saw that no moment was wasted. If a patient wasn’t being seen, we were prepping for the next or writing reports on the last. I especially enjoyed meeting the other doctors in the office and discussing their different educational routes.\n\nWhen seeing patients, Dr. Ismailyan would quiz me with questions about the tools he used. I was able to tell him that the gel he was using would prevent bleeding, or the blue paper he asked patients to grind between their teeth would prove a successful filling was done. Standing over his shoulder, taking notes as he consulted with and operated on patients led me to deciding two things. First, My future will be dedicated to helping others. Second, I want to study medicine, because under all the excitement, there was a sense of belonging.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"true","image":978,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9757c-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you\n\nFinding Truths\n\nIn my life, I have taken many journeys without which I would not have experienced important truths. My father started us off early, taking us on many journeys to help us understand that true knowledge comes only from experience. We took trips every winter break to Madrid, Mexico, Costa Rica, and to Jamaica and Trinidad, my parents’ homeland for Christmas. Silly things I remember from those trips include the mango chili sauce on the pork in Maui, the names of the women who gave out the towels by the pools in Selva Verde, Costa Rica, eating dinner at 10 p.m. in Spain. These were all tourist experiences that I, at first, found spellbinding. My truths were the truths of the tourist brochures: beautiful hotels, beaches, and cities. I did not see the blindfolds. I did not appreciate how being held hostage by the beauty of the surface—the beaches and cities—blinded me to the absence of Puerto Rican natives on the streets of San Juan; I did not understand how the prevalence and familiarity of English conspired to veil the beauty of the Spanish language beneath volumes of English translations.\n\nI learned more about these truths in my sophomore year of high school, when I was among a group of students selected to visit Cuba. My grandmother was born in Cuba, yet I had never thought to research my own heritage. I have remained the naïve American who saw Castro as some distant enemy of my country, accepting this as fact because this seemed to be the accepted wisdom. I soon became intrigued, however, with this supposed plague to my freedom, my culture, and everything good and decent. I began to think, just what is communism anyway? What’s so bad about Castro and Cuba—and I hear they have good coffee. I believed that what was missing was a lack of understanding between our two cultures, and that acceptance of our differences would come only with knowledge.\n\nMy first impression of Cuba was the absence of commercialism. I saw no giant golden arch enticing hungry Cubans with beef-laced fries; I did see billboards of Che Guevara and signposts exhorting unity and love. I realized, however, that much of the uniqueness that I relished here might be gone if the trade blockades in Cuba were ever lifted. The parallels and the irony were not lost on me. I was stepping out of an American political cave that shrouded the beauty of Cuba and stepping into another, one built on patriotic socialism, one where truths were just as ideological as, yet very different from, mine.\n\nHistory, I recognized, is never objective. The journeys I have taken have been colored by my prior experiences and by what my feelings were in those moments. Everyone holds a piece of the truth. Maybe facts don’t matter. Perhaps my experience is my truth and the more truths I hear from everyone else, the closer I will get to harmonization. Maybe there is no harmony, and I must go through life challenging and being challenged, perhaps finding perspectives from which I can extract—but never call—truth. I must simply find ways to understand others, to seek in them what is common to us all and perhaps someday find unity in our common human bond. This is what life has taught me so far, my sum of truths gleaned from experiencing many cultures. I don’t know if these truths will hold, but I hope that my college experience will be like my trip to Cuba—challenging some truths, strengthening others, and helping me experience new ones.","prompt":"","college":"Connecticut College","year":2007,"status":"accepted","author":"Soraya Palmer","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":405,"date":"2018-11-16T23:52:36.632Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9757d-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"My small body and head of curly hair trotted over to the refrigerator in search of some butter for my bread. I shifted some cans of half-opened Goya beans and the remnant of a brick of dulce de leche that had seen better days. After much shuffling, I spotted the big brown container of margarine. Carefully placing the tub on the kitchen table and readying for my “feast,” I opened the container. To my dismay, it was filled with arroz con pollo. My eyes tightened and my stomach made Chewbacca noises. Maybe I could mash the dulce de leche on top of the bread.\n\nMy finding was not a surprise. Rather it was lesson number 73 engraved within the book of Dominican-bred frugality. Why buy 99 cent storage containers when the products we buy already provide them for free? These lessons came in Spanish with the speed of a bull in a bullring. It is a struggle for immigrant parents to successfully pass on values of frugality to their children while living in a developed country with a perceived flow of plenty. But my mother’s iron will was the perfect match for those incongruences.\n\nFor a child, things like magic, fairy tales, and free MacBook offers make it difficult to grasp the value of money and to quantify the struggles that some families face to make ends meet. The collective hope is that through hard work and a miracle, one ends up figuring out how to make five dollars out of five cents.\n\nThis fervor to be frugal and purposeful is something that was passed down to me much like some families pass down an obsession with monogramming or Thanksgiving Day traditions. My trailblazing family’s thrifty efforts were legendary in our neighborhood. We started reusing and repurposing way before it was trendy. We made do with what we had and made what we had do more in order to awkwardly swim toward the Dominican American dream.\n\nFrugality is a game, or at least we made it into one. A game of who can save the most money by turning off lights, keeping the heater off and going to the library when the apartment got too hot. A game of who could make a skirt out of a short dress or find a scholarship for swimming lessons at the Y.M.C.A. The act of conserving money, the audacity to solve problems no one has thought of before is what set my family apart. Together we share our victories in a little tribe of four Amazon warriors partaking in our own version of the show, Survivor: NYC edition.\n\nThe phrase “making do” could evoke connotations of stagnation and despair for some; but for me it is about understanding my situation and being proactive. The values I gained from being able to make do are unparalleled. Making do gifted me with resiliency and gratitude. Making do allowed me to internalize acceptance and to value effort.\n\nLesson 978 took place last winter. I woke up at home with numb toes. The temperature inside the house was evidently no different from outside. I questioned my seemingly crazy mother to which she replied, “Come cuddle with me.” With closer inspection, I found my two sisters under the covers. The average family can spend up to $1,000 on heating their apartment, but my home is already comforting in its own way. A small bed with too many people in it, arms and legs perfectly intertwined. It doesn’t get better than that on a cold morning.\n\nThe laughs we exchange keep me warm, my grandmother’s advice, sigue adelante, or keeping moving forward, resonates with me, the arroz con pollo in the butter container satisfies me and our love for each other fuels me with drive to excel. We make do everyday and through our doing and making I know in my heart, the best is yet to come.","prompt":"","college":"New York University","year":2015,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"true","image":1044,"date":"2018-11-11T06:27:39.342Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9757e-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Influence? Why is it that the people who influence us most influence us in ways that are not easily quantified? Through her work with abused children, my mother has shown me the heroism of selfless dedication to a worthy cause. By being an upstanding individual, my playwriting teacher in middle school acted as an inspiring male role model at a time when I needed one most. By being approachable and interesting, my World History teacher in my freshman year of high school opened my eyes to the connections between a society's culture and its history and broadened my view of cultures and the world. While these influences mean much to me and have contributed greatly to my development, they came too easily to mind.\n\nThe fact that I could sit down and write a list of how these people influenced me suggests that the influence did not alter me in any profound way. These people are all my elders, and perhaps I feel distanced from them. The person whose influence shook me to the deepest level is a person whose influence is nearly impossible to describe. Mike, the best friend I’ve ever had, changed me, and I changed him at one of the most crucial times in our lives: the seventh grade. We developed our personalities, our senses of humor, and our love for girls at the same time and in the same manner. It would cheapen his influence to quantify it; I am what I am because of him; I cannot say that about anybody else.\n\nMike came to my school in the seventh grade, and we immediately clicked. Before he came, I didn’t feel like an outcast by any means, as I had my friends that I had known since first grade. However, until Mike, I never had anyone my age to identify with completely. Mike made me feel confident in who I was; he reaffirmed my drives and my thoughts and my inspirations. At this awkward stage in our lives, we found uncritical appreciation in each other. We both were obsessed by movies and had a similar sense of humor. We had the same problems and the same thoughts. That was all it took.\n\nHalfway through that same year, Mike and I became inseparable. In fact, our yearbook had a section that lists the names of students and what they were never seen without. Under Mike, it read: “Ted, ” and under Ted: “Mike.” I became a staple at his house and he at mine. We no longer had to ask our parents if it was ok to have a sleepover on weekends, they assumed we would. On weekdays, we usually walked over to his house, which was near school, and hung out there till I had to go home. Our favorite past time on those long afternoons after school was to walk to the nearby food mart and get a bag of chips and two 24 oz. Coca-Colas. Watching a movie, we would sit on his couch with our chips and Coke and talk about our dreams of working together in the movies. Mike wanted to be a director and actor, and I wanted to be an actor and a playwright/screenwriter. It was the perfect combination. We even tried writing a few scripts together.\n\nOf course, as two seventh grade boys, it wasn’t all skips through the park either. We were extremely competitive and would get into brutal fights for seemingly no reason at all. One time, I pulled out a chunk of his hair, but I don’t remember what started the fight. I think that our connection was so intense that we could not have normal emotions toward each other. As friends, we were best friends, but in an argument, we wanted to fight each other to the death. Still, the Wrestlemania days were rare; ordinarily, the intensity of that connection was a good thing. I was pretty shy about girls, and when I did talk about them with guys, I would usually just say a girl was \"hot.\" With Mike, I could really talk about girls and who they were; with Mike, I didn’t have to put on my public “cool” façade but could really say what I felt about a girl.\n\nThen we went to separate high schools. We tried to maintain the friendship, and you might think we would have been able to since we had been so close, but we drifted apart. Our friendship was based on being near each constantly, of growing up in the same town, under the same conditions, with the same hopes, fears, and dreams. Now we still go to movies occasionally and hang out, but it's not the same, and we both know it. I thought Mike and I would be friends forever, and maybe we will be. I mean, we have to make those movies together, right? But the way things look right now, I doubt we will ever reconnect. Our friendship in the seventh grade was magical, and lightning doesn’t strike twice.\n\nMy playwriting teacher from middle school left, but I handled it. I learned a great deal from him, and I appreciate him for the subject he taught and the way that he taught it. I will probably miss my parents when I leave for college, but I doubt the separation will pain me deeply since the connection between parents and children will always be there. With Mike, I lost the best friend I ever had, and I lost that forever. Losing that kind of bond cuts deep, and I know it's the type of wound that doesn't heal. It’s the type of wound you just live with.\n\nBut just because we're not friends anymore, it doesn't slight the times we had when we were friends. Those times are what influenced me so deeply. No, Mike did not work some lesson into my heart, he worked himself into my heart, and even if I never see the guy again he changed me forever. I think that finding someone who you truly connect with and feel that you were destined to meet, someone who you feel truly understands you and makes you feel special, I think meeting someone like that is one of the most profound experiences you can have.","prompt":"","college":"Harvard University","status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"","image":859,"date":"2018-11-11T06:47:44.385Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f9757f-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Windows\n\nAn eerie silence draped over New Orleans on a humid morning as the insects scampered back into their burrows. It was Saturday morning and I was still lying in bed, playing with the mood ring that my best friend, Anna, had given me as a good luck charm going into fourth grade. It was turquoise, meaning “tranquility.” However, as I focused on the footsteps downstairs, I could tell that both of my parents were in a rush and that Mama was nervous, which was rare. Something was different.\n\nI ran down to grab breakfast, but the voice of the news reporter and the hurricane alert noise coming from the kitchen television distracted me. The words on the bottom of the screen read, “mandatory evacuation.” Papa told me to pack some toys for myself and for Rafa, my little brother. I figured we wouldn’t need much since there were so many activities in Houston, where we’d evacuated to before. This time, though, the highways were too congested to get there safely. Instead, we headed to Charity Hospital since Papa, a neuroradiologist, was on call. With our previous experiences of nothing but strong winds and lights-out for a day or two, my parents decided it would be best for the four of us to stay together.\n\nIrina RojasWe were assigned to a small room on the 14th floor with two tiny twin beds. That night, the rain pounded on the old windows, like an angry crowd getting more and more agitated. At 1 a.m., a fierce air pressure in the room created a sharp pain in my ears, awakening us, only a mere second before the windows imploded. Shards of glass flew around the room, forcing us to hide in a stuffy hallway storage closet. We huddled around the handheld radio’s static for the next five hours.\n\nAfter the hurricane passed, I could tell Mama was distressed, yet she still managed to smile and say, “Te quiero mucho mi amor, todo va a estar bien.” The next morning, one of the doctors urged us to look out the window. I simply stood there, holding Papa’s sweaty hand, listening to the muddy waters from the Mississippi rushing in.\n\nNo one expected what would come next. In the basement, the emergency generators flooded, and the smell of rotting corpses from the morgue grew, getting stronger with the heat. In the lobby, people broke into the vending machines, stealing and selling the food. We didn’t have any clean water either, so showers soon became Purell sanitation wipes, and toilets became buckets to throw out the window. During the day, my parents were busy, so Rafa and I painted “SOS” on bed sheets and hung them outside. At night, we played cards, and I silently sat next to a nurse who thought about the dog she had left at home. No one knew if our homes or friends were okay, nor when we’d be rescued, but I didn’t cry. I was in survival mode.\n\nA week later, we were rescued on swamp boats. That year, I attended four different schools. When it was over, I wept uncontrollably. Hurricane Katrina has challenged me. It has humbled and motivated me. I want to be a doctor, like the ones at Charity. I saw them work together, tirelessly, caring for anyone that they could, even dropping a joke here and there. I will never forget the man who gave me his secret stash of candy, or the night that we celebrated a birthday with a tuna sandwich as the cake, a Q-tip for the candle, and how they sliced it for everyone to share. We never gave up. I learned to appreciate everything and everyone around me. I became stronger.","prompt":"","college":"Hamillton College","year":2003,"status":"accepted","author":"Irina Rojas","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"","image":723,"date":"2018-11-17T21:28:44.066Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97580-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Superheroes\n\nLegends, lore, and comic books all feature mystical, beautiful beings and superheroes—outspoken powerful Greek goddesses, outspoken Chinese maidens, and outspoken blade-wielding women. As a child, I soared the skies with my angel wings, battled demons with katanas, and helped stop everyday crime (and of course had a hot boyfriend). In short, I wanted to save the world.\n\nBut growing up, my definition of superhero shifted. My peers praised people who loudly fought inequality, who rallied and shouted against hatred. As a journalist on a social-justice themed magazine, I spent more time at protests, interviewing and understanding but not quite feeling inspired by their work.\n\nAt first, I despaired. Then I realized: I’m not a superhero.\n\nI’m just a 17-year-old girl with a Nikon and a notepad—and I like it that way.\n\nAnd yet—I want to save the world.\n\nThis understanding didn’t arrive as a bright, thundering revelation; it settled in softly on a warm spring night before my 17th birthday, around the fourth hour of crafting my journalism portfolio. I was choosing the best photos I’d taken around town during the 2016 presidential election when I unearthed two shots.\n\nThe first was from a peace march—my classmates, rainbows painted on their cheeks and bodies wrapped in American flags. One raised a bullhorn to her mouth, her lips forming a loud O. Months later, I could still hear her voice.\n\nThe second was different. The cloudy morning following election night seemed to shroud the school in gloom. In the mist, however—a golden face, with dark hair and two moon-shaped eyes, faces the camera. Her freckles, sprinkled like distant stars across the expanse of her round cheeks, only accentuated her childlike features and added to the soft feel of the photo. Her eyes bore into something beyond the lens, beyond the photographer, beyond the viewer—everything is rigid, from the jut of her jaw, to her stitched brows, her upright spine and arms locked across her chest, to her shut mouth. I picked the second picture within a heartbeat.\n\nDuring my career as a photojournalist, I lived for the action shots: the excited gestures of a school board member discussing plans, a rabbi preaching vividly, a group of teenagers chanting and waving flags downtown. To me, the most energetic photos always told the biggest and best stories. They made me feel important for being there, for capturing the superheroes in the moment to share with everyone else. The softer moments paled in comparison, and I thought of them as irrelevant.It took about one second to tear down one year’s worth of belief.\n\nThe idea dawned on me when I was trapped within the distraught weight in the girl’s eyes. Sometimes the moments that speak the loudest aren’t the noisiest or the most energetic. Sometimes they’re quiet, soft, and peaceful.\n\nNow, I still don’t completely understand who I am and who I want to be, but really, who does? I’m not a superhero—but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to save the world. There are just so many ways to do it.\n\nYou don’t always have to be loud to inflict change. Sometimes, it begins quietly: a snap of the shutter; a scrape of ink on paper. A breathtaking photograph; an astonishing lede. I’ve noticed the impact creativity can have and how powerful it is to harness it.\n\nSo, with that, I make people think and understand those surrounding them. I play devil’s advocate in discussions about ethics and politics. I persuade those around me to think past what they know into the scary territory of what they don’t—so to make people feel. I’m determined to inspire people to think more about how they can be their own superheroes and more.\n\nSee, that’s the kind of world-saving I do.","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":790,"date":"2018-11-11T04:44:20.166Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f97581-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Me(s): A One-Act Play\n\n(Several of me occupy themselves around my bedroom.

I smiled as I thought about the joy these cookies would bring to my friends. They like to compare me to the witch in Hansel and Gretel, joking that I fatten children up and then forget to eat them. I don’t particularly love being in the same company as an evil witch, but any rancor I might feel at this comparison is overwhelmed by my enjoyment of their anticipation of my baked goods.\n\nThere is something about the warmth of a kitchen filled with the buttery smell of pastry that evokes a feeling of utter relaxation. I find joy in sharing this warm and homey experience by showering the people around me with sweets. The smile that ticks up the corners of someone’s mouth as they bite into my food gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, baking has been an integral part of my life. Thanks to busy parents and hungry siblings, I was encouraged to cook from a relatively young age. Time spent in the kitchen naturally piqued my interest in baking, and that glimmer of interest blossomed into a heart-warming hobby that rejuvenates my stressful days, improves upon even the happiest moments, and brings joy to the people around me.\n\nThey say that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. It has been my experience that the way to ANYONE’S heart is through the stomach. To me, food is not simply about sustenance. The time that I spend in my kitchen, the effort and care that I pour into my confectionary creations, is a labor of love that brings me just as much satisfaction as it does my hungry friends and family.","prompt":"","college":"","year":2017,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"true","image":829,"date":"2018-11-17T21:36:56.669Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c70-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  \n\nI’ve utilized my creative and artistic individuality to impact my community and worldwide. Firstly, I created an online blog Blogging Everything Beautiful. I promote reading and literature and its significance to all age groups. For two years now, my blog has become a platform to express two of my passions, reading and art. On my website I graphically designed images. This expanded my knowledge when it came to working with design technology that I had little experience with. As someone who has enthusiasm for reading, I enjoy expressing my thoughts when it comes to reviewing and analyzing different works to a wider audience. Consequently, I’m able to gain different perspectives. \n\nBeing able to create an important art piece out of nothing really allows me to draw inspiration and past experiences from myself. This action enables me to self-reflect and realize how creating makes me feel internally -- happy, calm, and free. I’ve recently started to invest into the diverse community and advocate for authors of color and representation of cultures. This has given me exposure to what I’m passionate about, equality, and how I can involve my talent to advocate. Painting and blogging has become a hobby that I plan to make use of in the future to help balance leisure and work time. I’m definitely eager to progress over time as I believe that I have the ability to develop my creativity.\n\nIn addition to my blog, I’m also an online marketplace seller on Etsy. I showcase my artistic abilities by offering my paintings and works up for sale. I’ve been trying different mediums over the course of years, however I’m most comfortable with acrylic paint because of its ability to create such opaque images.  As I’ve experimented with new techniques, I’ve come to love self-expressive art movements such as Post Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism. I utilized my creative side in order to put myself on the marketplace, but to also structure my self confidence. To be creative in multiple ways is a fortunate aspect that I take advantage of, especially artistically and using innovative thinking to solve personal problems.\n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. \n\nOne opportunity that I have taken advantage of is the Education Talent Search Program powered by UC Davis. ETSP is a free program targeted towards students in need of guidance and support throughout their education. This support can range from providing a FAFSA mentor to students, from receiving workshops for the UC Application process.  During my sophomore year, I was invited to the program by my high school’s ETS adviser. I felt that I could utilize extra information to ensure a stable education and maintain an enthusiastic attitude throughout high school. I’ve been encouraged to focus on career paths and financial aid opportunities, such as EOP in college. For example, I’ve taken advantage of being informed about SAT and ACT deadlines, as well as scholarship information and guidance for the Cal State Apply.  I knew that I wanted to be aware of educational options that I could use to be prosperous for my future. With that being said,  I attended the meetings and kept in touch with my ETS adviser every month. I took advantage of being able to receive SAT and ACT waivers, attending Senior Day at a UC Campus, and to a Preview Day for incoming college freshmen. These exposures were valuable as this was an educational opportunity for me to ready myself. I’ve been able to visit several University campuses within California, speak to students that attend UCs and CSUs, and get connected with further resources that have expanded my range of possibilities. By investing myself into ETS, I’ve been able to recognize just how much there is to know about my future. This program has become important in supporting and guiding my academic work. Therefore, I took a significant advantage into my own hands and used resources available that will benefit me in the future. Overall it has become a major commitment worth my attention.\n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? \n\nThe most significant challenge that I have faced is when I realized that I may be clinically depressed. This was a constant challenge that affected my educational performance, communication skills, and comfortability within my household and community. At the time, I frequently dismissed this mentality as I needed to focus on my schoolwork. However, my academic execution was negatively impacted as I was inattentive in class and neglected to sleep or eat. Throughout the past years I’ve still been overcoming this challenge, but it has become less difficult. I decided to use my resources and reach out to media sources, such as the Buddy Project, and my closest friends. The Buddy Project allows people to communicate with individuals who may have similar experiences to you. In the past, I was hesitant when it came to asking for help because I was content with being independent. I knew that I needed to take the situation into my own hands because it was ultimately affecting my academic achievements. I resorted to the first step of revitalization which is self-reflection. I focused on what wasn’t enjoyable about my unsettled development and I brainstormed ideas to dismiss these aspects from my life. This was the most difficult part of overcoming this challenge and I still haven’t entirely completed this step. However I found what I love and used that as a goal or reassurance that I can progress. I discovered that I’m more than this obstacle and now I can apply this experience to become a better me. I’ve acknowledged the negative environment that I was creating and realized that I didn’t want to be filled with sorrow and misplacement anymore. So I found myself a home. This sense of place was within my blog, my education, and literature. Often I was doubting my abilities because of my depression, but to overcome this I continued to understand my successes academically or personally. In fact, I’ve used this challenge to spark interest in future fields of study, such as psychology and sociology. I hope to apply this knowledge to a career as well.\n\nWhat have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  \n\nAt school I am currently the Vice President of Around the World club. Our main objective is to influence the school to acknowledge the world around us and how we can make a difference. We’ve organized an annual Breast Cancer Awareness Fundraiser and also collaborated with local companies to raise money for those affected by the Napa Valley Atlas Fires. In the past, we have visited local community centers to read to the youth and educate them. As a whole, we’ve become advocates of spreading awareness of the conditions of our community. This advocacy could range from environmental issues to social standards.  In order to get these events running within the club, I have taken the initiative of emailing companies professionally and handling paperwork throughout each meeting. Skills that I use within this club include using an authoritative voice when needed and applying my creative perspective towards producing effective fundraisers for my community.\n\nAnother form of community service that I have committed to is within the North Bay Mustangs Youth Sports Organization. Again, this is a community-based organization that has a main objective of keeping children away from bad influences, such as drugs, in order to keep them active and healthy. Using my morals and expressing good habits has become a vital part in making my community a better place, and it has been a privilege to be able to have a leadership role within it. I had the opportunity to involve myself with the youth and keep them active. This is done by attending their practices and games and being a figure of eagerness for the children. I also enthusiastically socialize and work with the team and family members in order to make their experience as worthwhile as mine. These opportunities and engagements have allowed me to become extroverted and to really apply my adventurous attitude in order to share my passions and create a better community  for future generations. I am now able to manage my life and other aspects adequately and prepare myself for other impactful developments.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"waitlisted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":927,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.874Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c71-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"A goal without a plan is just a wish, and I don't consider myself to be wishful thinker, but a person of practical approach. And so, when I began my freshman year of college, Louisiana State University was strategically the best available option. LSU offered the scholarships I needed, including the statewide TOPS program which, at the time, guaranteed the price of tuition for anyone with an ACT score of twenty-seven or above. Additionally, LSU had no cap on early credit, which allowed me to put to use the seventy-four hours I had amassed in high school towards pursuing majors in political science, economics, and French with an Arabic minor. However, I didn't know the hindrances I would face at LSU in pursuit of my chosen career path until I was plugged into the campus community, at which point I found a number of pragmatic reasons that LSU is no longer appropriate for the goals towards which I am working. The obstacles began to arise when I finally honed my interests. I distinctly remember change brewing as I sat in my biweekly social contract seminar listening to my professor discuss the paper he was working on, in which he aimed to tie human prosociality to neuroplasticity, all of which, he argued, would undermine Hobbes' social contract theory. O That's what I wanted — not the subject matter, but the principle. I wanted to attempt, I wanted to learn and to theorize and even to be wrong sometimes. I wanted to translate my interdisciplinary interests in political and economic theory into applicable policy. Given my passions for writing and discussion, sharing theories and findings with colleagues and inspired students, too, was ideal. And so, I finally knew I wanted to be a professor of public policy. O Sadly, LSU did not have a public policy program, and so I defaulted to political science. However, the political science department is inherently theory-based rather than policy oriented. From studying the public policy curricula of other universities, I know that a public policy program is more suited to my own interests in applications of governance. Undeterred by this initial set back and eager to begin my journey in the world of academia, I immediately sought research opportunities, but I quickly learned that they weren't easily accessible. Upon meeting with counsellors, I was told I would have to find professors to work with on my own, as there was no designated undergraduate research database or protocol. This in itself was another stark concern as I need a university in which conducting research is as integral part of the collegiate experience as it is a necessity in my education and preparation for the future. Though I have contacted professors, happy to take any experience I can get, I have found that most positions are reserved for upperclassmen and are primarily data entry oriented. Also, the lack of a public policy program has meant that the available work I have found does not meet the particular needs of the future policy-oriented research in which I hope to engage. Though I know I could do well at LSU and receive an amazing education, staying at the university would mean, at best, having to overcome serious curricular deficits in achieving my goals or, at worst, having to change my plans altogether. And so, I have resolved to transfer in an effort to give myself the best possible opportunity to prepare for and succeed in my future.","prompt":"","college":"","year":2017,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":21,"date":"2018-11-25T00:03:12.350Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c72-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Keeping my head down and avoiding eye contact, I tried not to attract attention. Drunken shrieks and moans reverberated through the darkening light of the bus stop, while silhouettes and shadows danced about. My heart pounding, I hoped I would survive the next 40 minutes. I had never seen the homeless at the stop act so deranged. But I had never been there so late.\n\nIt was well past sundown. A man passed out on the next bench awoke only to shout and drink. One screamed racial slurs and curses at another while they both staggered around. Another lacked an arm and had the most baleful gaze I had ever seen. As much as I tried to empathize and feel compassion, I couldn’t stymie a feeling of terror and revulsion.\n\nAfter a few long minutes, a shadow detached itself from the opposite benches, came over and sat down next to me. Squinting, I took in her kind, wrinkled face. Ah, thank god, a kindred soul enduring the same thing.\n\nNathaniel Colburn“Missed the bus?” she asked.\n\n“Y-yeah,” I mumbled.\n\n“You certainly chose the wrong time to do that. Where’re you headed?” Her voice was scratchy, like a smoker’s, but she spoke well.\n\n“Home.”\n\n“Ah, homes. When I was a bit older than you, my home was a car. Can you believe that my car, an old Toyota, got 50 miles to the gallon? I could drive from here to San Francisco in one sitting.”\n\nNo, I couldn’t. The more we talked, the more I enjoyed her company and forgot about the craziness around me. She grew up in San Francisco and loved to travel. She loved helping people and went to church. Before I could learn more, a homeless man staggered up to me and asked me for money. I was so uncomfortable I relented.\n\nMy friend turned to me and advised, “Don’t ever give a homeless person money. Give them food. The stereotype is true — they buy drugs and alcohol. Look around you.”\n\nStunned and feeling naïve, I promised to do so. We talked more until my stomach rumbled and I remarked that I hadn’t eaten since lunch. Just then a bus arrived — apparently hers. She procured two hardboiled eggs from her pocket and offered them to me. I politely declined, and she went to get her stuff. But wait, why was she carrying eggs in her pocket? When the woman emerged from the other side of the stop, she boarded the bus with a sleeping bag and backpack. She was homeless! She smiled down at me, the bus left, and I sat there in quiet shock.\n\nI explored the stop anew. Drugs, alcohol, missing limbs were no longer terrifying. Now, I saw the symptoms of sickness, a sad lifestyle that did no harm except to those who lived it.\n\nThe homeless lady probably has no idea what an effect she had on me. Because of her, I swore to look through the top layers of every situation. Now that I have a car, I never go to the bus stop, but I know its lesson, at least, will continue to take me places. I hope my expanded empathy and open-mindedness will allow me to feel at home in any foreign situation and connect with all people. Next time I might even accept a hardboiled egg straight out of a stranger’s coat pocket.","prompt":"","college":"Hamillton College","year":"","status":"accepted","author":"Nathaniel Colburn","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"","image":894,"date":"2018-11-17T21:16:00.189Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c73-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"They covered the precious mahogany coffin with a brown amalgam of rocks, decomposed organisms, and weeds. It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life.\n\nWhen my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing.\n\nI became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter.  \n\nHowever, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow humans.   \n\nVolunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together.\n\nCancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life. It’s easy to forget when one’s mind and body are so weak and vulnerable. I want to be there as an oncologist to remind them to take a walk once in a while, to remember that there’s so much more to life than a disease. While I physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the interruption and continue living. Through my work, I can accept the shovel without burying my grandmother’s memory.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":372,"date":"2018-11-11T05:27:12.558Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c74-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe a challenge you overcame.\n\nThe stiff black apron hung awkwardly on my hips as I casually tried to tie the strings around my waist. I had been at Gino’s Restaurant for only ten minutes when Maurizio, the manager, grabbed my arm abruptly and said, “Follow me to the dungeon.” Unsure of whether or not he was joking, I smiled eagerly at him, but his glare confirmed his intent. I wiped the smirk off my face and followed him through the kitchen, which was louder than Madison Square Garden during a Knicks/Pacers game. A tall woman with a thick Italian accent pushed me while barking, “Move it, kid, you’re blocking traffic.” I later learned she was a waitress, and waitresses did not associate with the low-level busboys. Maurizio brought me to a dangerously steep staircase that looked like it had been purposely drenched in oil to increase the chance of a fall. As he gracefully flew down each step, I clutched onto the rusty tile walls, strategically putting one foot first and then the other. Eventually, I entered the “dungeon” and was directed to a table to join two men who were vigorously folding napkins.\n\nPretending to know what had to be done, I took a pile of unfolded starched napkins and attempted to turn them into the Gino accordion. I slowly folded each corner, trying to leave exactly one inch on both sides, and ignored the giggles and whispers coming from across the table. When I finished my first napkin, I quickly grabbed another and tried again, hiding my pathetic initial attempt under my thigh. On my second try, I sighed with relief when I saw that what I had constructed slightly resembled an accordion shape. However, when I looked up, I saw that the other two men had each finished twenty perfect napkins. “Hurry up, little girl,” they said in unison, “We have lots left.” They pointed to a closet overflowing with white linens as I began to fold my third. The next couple of nights afforded me the opportunity to master such tasks as refilling toilet paper dispensers and filling breadbaskets. Just as I began to find solace in these more manageable jobs, I felt a forceful tap on my shoulder. A heavyset waiter who was sweating profusely barked, “I need one decaf cappuccino. Understand?”\n\n“Um, okay,” I stuttered, unable to get up enough courage to admit that I had never attempted to make a cappuccino. I glanced over at the intimidating espresso machine and started to pace back and forth. The waiter reappeared and with a look of irritation snapped, “If you didn’t know how to do it, why didn’t you say so? I don’t have time for this!” Returning to the unnecessary re-cleaning of silverware, the only job I could comfortably perform, it dawned on me that my fear of showing ignorance had rendered me incompetent. I had mastered the art of avoidance and had learned nothing. I continued to clean vigorously, making sure to keep my eyes on the silverware so that no one would ask me to make another cappuccino.\n\nHaving barely made it through my first weekend at the restaurant, I was amazed at how relieved I felt to return to the familiarity of physics class. We were starting a new chapter on fiber optics. Moving through the material with greater ease than I had anticipated, we hit upon the topic of optical time domain reflectometers, and sweat began to form on my chest as I frantically flipped through my notebook. I marked my paper with an asterisk so that I would know to ask my teacher to explain this material when I met with him privately during my next free period. My teacher then said, “So, I’m sure you all understand OTDR, so let’s move on.” As all of my peers nodded in agreement, I suddenly realized that I was still not asking how to make cappuccino. I took a deep breath and the fear of not learning overcame my usual fear of looking foolish and I raised my hand. After my question had been answered, I felt like the Red Sox lifting the curse. I erased the star I had made on my notebook and confidently listened as we moved on to the next topic.\n\nI’m not suggesting that raising my hand and asking a question in physics class was a life-changing moment. It did not suddenly rid me of my fear of showing ignorance, but it definitely marked a new willingness to ask questions. When I returned to Gino’s the next weekend, I continued to spend some time unnecessarily cleaning silverware, but after asking Maurizio how to use the espresso machine, I soon added making cappuccino to my list of life skills.","prompt":"","college":"University of Pennsylvania","year":2009,"status":"accepted","author":"Leigh Rosen","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":802,"date":"2018-11-17T00:18:30.126Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c75-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"My father takes me down to the arroyo when I am so small that I do not yet reach his waist. My feet fumble across flaking desert skin and he pulls me along gently by my hand and tells me to be careful of small cacti and the bones of dead jack rabbits. He does not let me straddle the rift where the earth divides into repelling mounds of sand. Instead, he slips his hands beneath my arms and swings me around in a half circle, his red face wrinkling into a smile.\n\nThat morning, my father had crept into my room with the sun and shaken me into consciousness. “Get your sneakers,” he had whispered. “We’re going on a treasure hunt.”\n\nIt is minutes later now and we are trudging down an overgrown trail, tactfully descending the deep slopes of New Mexican land. Everything smells strongly of mud and salt and soaked manure from the horse barn down the road. I almost trip over a weed, but my father steadies me and says, “Almost there, baby.”\n\nThe arroyo is different than I have ever seen it. It is scattered with long, silver puddles. In the pink glow of the rising sun, the sand looks shiny and slippery. Around us, green tufts of vegetation burst from the earth in unpredictable patterns and yellow wildflowers with thin stems knock softly against each other in the wind.\n\nMy father tells me to wait and he steps down into the wet sand. I watch as his sandals sink deep into the ground and leave long footsteps. He crouches suddenly, and digs into the earth with a discarded stick. Then he stands, approaches me, and places in my hand something slimy and smooth.\n\n“A pottery shard,” he says, in explanation. “From the Native Americans, who lived right here a thousand years ago. The rain washes them up. If we’re lucky, we’ll find all the pieces of an entire pot.”\n\nI look down at the strange triangular stone and wipe the sand from its surface. He lifts me up in his arms, carries me back toward the house.\n\nMy father gives me a book about Georgia O’Keeffe for my fifth birthday. We read it together and he bounces me on his knee and licks his fingertips before turning the pages. He points at a landscape that looks like a rumpled tablecloth and tells me, “This is why we’re here.” I steal a flashlight and flip through the book under my covers at night. I touch the same glossy picture and whisper, “This is why we’re here.”\n\nWhen I am 6 years old, the Sunday school teacher asks me what my father does for a living. I tell her he is an artist like Georgia O’Keeffe. I do not know that I am lying. I do not know that he hasn’t sold a piece in months. I do not know that my mother sits at the kitchen table after I go to sleep and cries because the mortgage is past due and she can’t figure out a way to tell me that this year, Santa Claus just might not make it.\n\nFor Christmas, my father gives me a sparkling blue stone he found in the arroyo. I say thank you and pretend I mean it. Later, I stand on the edge of our brick patio and wind up my arm and throw the rock as far as it will go. It disappears inside the bristles of a pine tree.\n\nI do not say goodbye to the arroyo before shutting the car door and stretching the seatbelt across my chest. I do not say goodbye because I think that I won’t miss it. We are leaving New Mexico. We are going to New York where my father will get a real job and we will become a real family. We drive alongside a cliff, the rock rough and jagged and sprinkled with a thousand tiny diamonds. I press my finger against the glass. This is why we’re here.\n\nWhen I am 16 years old, my father takes me back to New Mexico and we go once more to the arroyo. The neglected trail is long gone now and we stumble in our tennis shoes over dried up cacti and colorless desert flowers. I am too old now to hold my father’s hand. He walks a few steps ahead of me and I do not see his face.\n\nThe arroyo is bone-dry, littered with dented soda cans, beaten strips of tire and mud-stained garbage bags. Many monsoon seasons have left the sides of the arroyo tall and smooth, except for the dried roots of long-dead plants, still lodged in the dirt, which reach out toward us like skeleton hands.\n\nMy father crouches over and his shirt draws taut across his back. He delicately parts the earth with his fingers and searches for something that he will never find again.\n\n“No more pottery,” he says. He looks at me and squints his eyes against the sun. “It must have washed far away by now.”\n\nSuddenly comes to me the vague image of my father in ripped jeans, pressing a pottery shard into my palm.\n\nI wonder if he, too, has washed far away.","prompt":"","college":"Virginia Tech","year":2015,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Virginia","featured":"","image":755,"date":"2018-11-11T06:24:44.225Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c76-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"‘On one side of me, nature is a hobby.

Given your personal background, describe an experience that illustrates what you would bring to the diversity in the college community or an encounter that demonstrated the importance of diversity to you.\n\nI feel sick. I’m nervous and my stomach’s turning. The room is lined with neat rows of desks, each one occupied by another kid my age. We’re all about to take the SATs. The proctor has instructed us to fill out section four: “race.”\n\nI cannot be placed neatly into a single racial category, although I’m sure that people walking down the street don’t hesitate to label me “caucasian.” Never in my life has a stranger not been surprised when I told them I was half black.\n\nHaving light skin, eyes, and hair, but being black and white often leaves me misperceived. Do I wish that my skin were darker so that when I tell people I’m black they won’t laugh at me? No, I accept and value who I am. To me, being black is more than having brown skin; it’s having ancestors who were enslaved, a grandfather who managed one of the nation’s oldest black newspapers, the Chicago Daily Defender, and a family who is as proud of their heritage as I am. I prove that one cannot always discern another’s race by his or her appearance.\n\nI often find myself frustrated when explaining my racial background, because I am almost always proving my “blackness” and left neglecting my Irish-American side. People have told me that “one drop of black blood determines your race,” but I opt not to follow this rule. In this country a century ago, most mixed-race children were products of rape or other relationships of power imbalance, but I am not. I am a child in the twenty-first century who is a product of a loving relationship. I choose the label biracial and identify with my black and Irish sides equally. I am proud to say that my paternal great-grandparents immigrated to this country from Ireland and that I have found their names on the wall at Ellis Island, but people are rarely interested in that. They can’t get over the idea that this girl, who according to their definition looks white, is not.\n\nLast year, at my school’s “Sexual Awareness Day,” a guest lecturer spoke about the stereotypical portrayal of different types of people on MTV’s The Real World. He pointed out that the white, blond-haired girls are always depicted as completely ditsy and asked me how it felt to fit that description. I wasn’t surprised that he assumed I was white, but I did correct his mistake. I told him that I thought the show’s portrayal of white girls with blond hair was unfair. I went on to say that we should also be careful not to make assumptions about people based on their physical appearance. “For example,” I told him, “I’m not white.” It was interesting that the lecturer, whose goal was to teach students not to judge or make assumptions about people based on their sexual orientation, had himself made a racial assumption about me.\n\nI often find myself wishing that racial labels didn’t exist so that people wouldn’t rely on race alone to understand a person’s thoughts, actions, habits, and personality. One’s race does not reveal the content of their character. When someone finds out that I am biracial, do I become a different person in his or her eyes? Am I suddenly “deeper,” because I’m not just the “plain white girl” they assumed I was? Am I more complex? Can they suddenly relate to me more (or less)? No, my race alone doesn’t reveal who I am. If one’s race cannot be determined simply by looking at a person, then how can it be possible to look at a person and determine her inner qualities?\n\nThrough census forms, racial questionnaires on the SATs, and other devices, our society tries to draw conclusions about people based on appearance. It is a quick and easy way to categorize people without taking the time to get to know them, but it simply cannot be done.","prompt":"","college":"New York University","year":2007,"status":"accepted","author":"Daniele Melia","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":28,"date":"2018-11-16T23:58:37.293Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c78-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Time to Spin the Wheel\n\nFor as long as I can remember, one of my favorite pastimes has been manipulating those tricky permutations of 26 letters to fill in that signature, bright green gridded board of Wheel of Fortune.\n\nEvery evening at precisely 6:30 p.m., my family and I unfailingly gather in our living room in anticipation of Pat Sajak’s cheerful announcement: “It’s time to spin the wheel!” And the game is afoot, our banter punctuated by the potential of either big rewards or even bigger bankruptcies: “She has to know that word—my goodness, why is she buying a vowel?!”\n\nWhile a game like Wheel of Fortune is full of financial pitfalls, I wasn’t ever much interested in the money or new cars to be won. I found myself drawn to the letters and playful application of the English alphabet, the intricate units of language.\n\nFor instance, phrases like “I love you,” whose incredible emotion is quantized to a mere set of eight letters, never cease to amaze me. Whether it’s the definitive pang of a simple “I am” or an existential crisis posed by “Am I”, I recognized at a young age how letters and their order impact language.\n\nSpelling bees were always my forte. I’ve always been able to visualize words and then verbally string individual consonants and vowels together. I may not have known the meaning of every word I spelled, I knew that soliloquy always pushed my buttons: that -quy ending was so bizarre yet memorable! And intaglio with its silent “g” just rolled off the tongue like cultured butter.\n\nEventually, letters assembled into greater and more complex words.\n\nI was an avid reader early on, devouring book after book. From the Magic Treehouse series to the too real 1984, the distressing The Bell Jar, and Tagore’s quaint short stories, I accumulated an ocean of new words, some real (epitome, effervescence, apricity), and others fully fictitious (doubleplusgood), and collected all my favorites in a little journal, my Panoply of Words.\n\nAdd the fact that I was raised in a Bengali household and studied Spanish in high school for four years, and I was able to add other exotic words. Sinfin, zanahoria, katukutu, and churanto soon took their rightful places alongside my English favorites.\n\nAnd yet, during this time of vocabulary enrichment, I never thought that Honors English and Biology had much in common. Imagine my surprise one night as a freshman as I was nonchalantly flipping through a science textbook. I came upon fascinating new terms: adiabatic, axiom, cotyledon, phalanges…and I couldn’t help but wonder why these non-literary, seemingly random words were drawing me in. These words had sharp syllables, were challenging to enunciate, and didn’t possess any particularly abstract meaning.\n\nI was flummoxed, but curious…I kept reading.\n\n“Air in engine quickly compressing…”\n\n“Incontestable mathematical truth…”\n\n“Fledgling leaf in an angiosperm…”\n\n“Ossified bones of fingers and toes…\n\n…and then it hit me. For all my interest in STEM classes, I never fully embraced the beauty of technical language, that words have the power to simultaneously communicate infinite ideas and sensations AND intricate relationships and complex processes.\n\nPerhaps that’s why my love of words has led me to a calling in science, an opportunity to better understand the parts that allow the world to function. At day’s end, it’s language that is perhaps the most important tool in scientific education, enabling us all to communicate new findings in a comprehensible manner, whether it be focused on minute atoms or vast galaxies.\n\nIt’s equal parts humbling and enthralling to think that I, Romila, might still have something to add to that scientific glossary, a little permutation of my own that may transcend some aspect of human understanding. Who knows, but I’m definitely game to give the wheel a spin, Pat, and see where it takes me…","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":54,"date":"2018-11-11T03:59:28.011Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c79-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.\n\nAt five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.\n\nIt was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.\n\nIt began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.\n\nIn the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.\n\nThen, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.\n\nInterestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world.\n\nBut the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin.\n\nI want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation.\n\nI think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\n\nToday, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too.","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Massachusetts","featured":"","image":893,"date":"2018-11-11T05:33:57.623Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c7a-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"And the Secret Ingredient is…\n\nStep 1: Get the ingredients\n\nOn the granite countertop in front of me sat a pile of flour, two sticks of butter, and a bowl of shredded beef, just like the YouTube tutorial showed. My mind contorted itself as I tried figuring out what I was doing. Flanking me were two equally discombobulated partners from my Spanish class. Somehow, some way, the amalgamation of ingredients before us would have to be transformed into Peruvian empanadas.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the ingredients\n\nIt looked easy enough. Just make a dough, cook the beef until it was tender, put two and two together, and fry them. What YouTube didn’t show was how to season the meat or how long you should cook it. We had to put this puzzle together by ourselves. Adding to the mystery, none of us knew what an empanada should even taste like.\n\nStep 3: Roll out ten equally sized circles of dough\n\nIt would be dishonest to say everything went smoothly. I thought the dough should be thick. One team member thought it should be thin. The other thought our circles were squares. A fundamental truth about collaboration is that it’s never uncontentious. Everyone has their own expectations about how things should be done. Everyone wants a project to go their way. Collaboration requires observing the differences between the collaborators and finding a way to synthesize everyone’s contributions into a solution that is mutually agreeable.\n\nStep 4: Cook the beef until tender\n\nCollaborative endeavors are the proving grounds for Murphy’s Law: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. The shredded beef, which was supposed to be tender, was still hard as a rock after an hour on the stove. With our unseasoned cooking minds, all ideas were valid. Put more salt in? Sure. Cook it at a higher temperature? Go for it. Collaboration requires people to be receptive. It demands an open mind. All ideas deserve consideration.\n\nStep 5: Fry the empanadas until crispy\n\nWhat does crispy even mean? How crispy is crispy enough; how crispy is too crispy? The back and forth with my teammates over everything from how thick the dough should be to the definition of crispy taught me a key ingredient of teamwork: patience. Collaboration breeds tension, which can make teamwork so frustrating. But it’s that very tension which also transforms differing perspectives into solutions that propel collaborative undertakings forward.\n\nStep 6: Enjoy!","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":102,"date":"2018-11-11T04:47:38.527Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c7b-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Prompt: Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?\n\nWith moments to spare, I catch a glimpse of the boarding platform for my train. Like a captain frantically seeking port in a storm, I haul myself through the turbulent ocean of people, trying to avoid being stranded – or trampled – in the dustiest city in the world: Beijing, capital of both China and smog.\n\nLuckily, I board my train with seconds to spare, and without being turned into a pancake – always a plus. The conductor welcomes me aboard. At last, it is time to return home to Shanghai.\n\nIt is the summer of 2012, and Shanghai isn’t to be home for much longer. In another week I will cross the globe to start a new life in a foreign land called Charlotte.\n\nWhich is home? The place I am leaving or the place I am going? Arrival or departure? Like a compass with a broken magnetic strip, I can’t decide my true North.\n\nUnsettled, I turn to my ever-present book for comfort. Today it is The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien, already worn and slightly crumpled. They say the best books tell you what you already know, resonating with your own thoughts and emotions. As I read, it is as if the tempest of my thoughts is spelled out on paper. The overflowing sense of hyper-reality in Tim O’Brien’s words of warfare spills into my world. His words somehow become my words, his memories become my memories. Despite the high speed of the bullet train, my mind is perfectly still – trapped between the narrative of the book and the narrative of my own life.\n\nI feel like I should feel disturbed, but I’m not. I read the last page and close the book, staring out the window at the shining fish ponds and peaceful rice paddies. I feel like a speck of dust outside the train, floating, content and happy to be between destinations.\n\nI am at home between worlds. I speak both English and Chinese: Chinese is for math, science, and process, but I prefer English for art, emotion, and description. America owns my childhood, filled with pine trees, blockbuster movies, and Lake Tahoe snow; China holds my adolescence, accompanied by industrial smog, expeditious mobility, and fast-paced social scenes.\n\nWe are drawing into Shanghai Hong Qiao station. My reverie isn’t at an end, but I have the answer to my question. Home is neither arrival nor departure, neither America nor China.

This student focused on a single question – where is home? – and showed the reader a lot about who he is as a person. Through this skillfully crafted essay, we learn that the student has led a very international life, the student has a way with words, the student loves literature, the student is bilingual, and the student is excited by change.

I write screenplays, short stories, and opinionated blogs and am a regular contributor to my school literary magazine, The Gluestick. I have accumulated over 300 community service hours that includes work at homeless shelters, libraries, and special education youth camps. I have been evaluated by the College Board and have placed within the top percentile.\n\nBut I am not any of these things. I am not a test score, nor a debater, nor a writer. I am an anti-nihilist punk rockphilosopher. And I became so when I realized three things:\n\n1) That the world is ruled by underwear. There is a variety of underwear for a variety of people. You have your ironed briefs for your businessmen, your soft cottons for the average, and hemp-based underwear for your environmental romantics. But underwear do not only tell us about who we are, they also influence our daily interactions in ways most of us don't even understand. For example, I have a specific pair of underwear that is holey, worn out but surprisingly comfortable. And despite how trivial underwear might be, when I am wearing my favorite pair, I feel as if I am on top of the world. In any case, these articles of clothing affect our being and are the unsung heroes of comfort.\n\n2) When I realized I cannot understand the world. I recently debated at the Orange County Speech League Tournament, within the Parliamentary Division. This specific branch of debate is an hour long, and consists of two parties debating either side of a current political issue. In one particular debate, I was assigned the topic: “Should Nation States eliminate nuclear arms?” It so happened that I was on the negative side and it was my job to convince the judges that countries should continue manufacturing nuclear weapons. During the debate, something strange happened: I realized that we are a special breed of species, that so much effort and resources are invested to ensure mutual destruction. And I felt that this debate in a small college classroom had elucidated something much more profound about the scale of human existence. In any case, I won 1st place at the tournament, but as the crowd cheered when my name was called to stand before an audience of hundreds of other debaters, and I flashed a victorious smile at the cameras, I couldn’t help but imagine that somewhere at that moment a nuclear bomb was being manufactured, adding to an ever-growing stockpile of doom. And that's when I realized that the world was something I will never understand.\n\n3) When I realized I was a punk rocker philosopher. One summer night, my friend took me to an underground hardcore punk rock show. It was inside a small abandoned church. After the show, I met and became a part of this small community. Many were lost and on a constant soul-search, and to my surprise, many, like myself, did not have a blue Mohawk or a nose piercing. Many were just ordinary people discussing Nietzsche, string theory, and governmental ideologies. Many were also artists creating promotional posters and inventive slogans for stickers. They were all people my age who could not afford to be part of a record label and did something extraordinary by playing in these abandoned churches, making their own CDs and making thousands of promotional buttons by hand. I realized then that punk rock is not about music nor is it a guy with a blue Mohawk screaming protests. Punk rock is an attitude, a mindset, and very much a culture. It is an antagonist to the conventional. It means making the best with what you have to contribute to a community. This was when I realized that I was a punk rock philosopher.\n\nThe world I come from consists of underwear, nuclear bombs, and punk rockers. And I love this world. My world is inherently complex, mysterious, and anti-nihilist. I am David Phan, somebody who spends his weekends debating in a three piece suit, other days immersed within the punk rock culture, and some days writing opinionated blogs about underwear.\n\nBut why college? I want a higher education. I want more than just the textbook fed classrooms in high school. A community which prizes revolutionary ideals, a sharing of multi-dynamical perspectives, an environment that ultimately acts as a medium for movement, similar to the punk rock community. I do not see college as a mere stepping stone for a stable career or a prosperous life, but as a supplement for knowledge and self-empowerment; it is a social engine that will jettison us to our next paradigm shift.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":353,"date":"2018-11-11T05:30:00.908Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c7d-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe something you have inherited that you find flawed.\n\nThe town files in for the 8 annual race between the tortoise, Joe T.

A Starbucks barista hands me my drink with a hand adorned by a small music note. Where I work, a customer hands me her credit card wearing a permanent flower bracelet. Every day, I am on a scavenger hunt to find women with this kind of permanent art. I'm intrigued by the quotes, dates, symbols, and abstract shapes I see on people that I interact with daily.

I don't have a concrete outcome in mind besides talking with a mix of interesting women with interesting tattoos. So far I've conducted fifteen interviews with a range of women from my hometown to Hawaii, teenagers to senior citizens, teachers to spiritual healers. The same set of questions has prompted interviews lasting less than twenty minutes and over two hours. I'm being told stories about deaths of a parent, struggles with cancer, coming out experiences, sexual assaults, and mental illnesses.

In my first interview, a local businesswoman told me about her rocky relationship with her mother, her struggles with mental illness, and her friend in jail, within 45 minutes of meeting her and in the middle of a busy Starbucks. An artist educator I worked with told me that getting a tattoo \"was like claiming a part of yourself and making it more visible and unavoidable.\" A model/homeopath said that having a tattoo is like \"giving people a little clue about you.\" A psychologist shared how she wishes that she could turn her tattoos \"on or off like a light switch to match different outfits and occasions.\" I've realized that tattoos show the complex relationship between the personal and the public (and how funny that can be when a Matisse cutout is thought to be phallic, or how a social worker's abstract doodle is interpreted as a tsunami of sticks, alien spaceship, and a billion other things by the children she works with).\n\nI've learned so much about the art of storytelling and storytelling through art.

Over lunch one day, we discovered we shared a common passion—an insistence on equality in all forms, feminism in particular. We discussed the difficulty of combating social issues, but agreed that spreading awareness was one effective method. This casual exchange evolved into a project involving weeks of collaboration. We realized that together we could make a far greater impact than we ever could have individually, so we composed a ten-minute poem aimed at inspiring people to consider important issues. We began by drafting stanzas, simultaneously editing one another’s writing, and later progressed to memorization, practicing together until our alternating lines flowed and phrases spoken together were completely synchronized. The performance was both memorable and successful, but more importantly, this collaboration motivated us to move forward to establish the Equality Club at our school.

This year we are collaborating with the Judicial Committee to reduce the escalating use of racial slurs at school stemming from a lack of awareness within the student body. From this experience, I learned that it is possible to reach so many more people when working together rather than apart. It also taught me that the most crucial aspect of collaborating is believing in the same cause; the details will come as long as there is a shared passion.","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Maryland","featured":"","image":1065,"date":"2018-11-11T04:21:27.066Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c80-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  \n\nDuring junior year I was part of both Link Crew and Track. I joined Link Crew because my freshman year wasn’t fun, I had no Link Leader to turn to, and was left alone to figure out my way, so I wanted to make sure other freshmen didn’t have to go through what I went through. Being a Link Crew Leader, the freshmen who did Track found it easier to talk and hang out with me more than the other upperclassmen because I had met them before during Freshman orientation and Link Crew classroom visits. During one of our conversations Devyn, One of these freshman, told me that he believed that track was taking time away from him working on his football skills. He expressed to me that all of the other freshmen on the team were becoming better football players than he was and that they were passing him up. When he told me about this, I had an idea how to help him out using my knowledge that I gained from being both an athlete and in Link Crew, and I was able to give him some key advice. I let him know that Track was teaching him proper running form, increasing his speed, and improving his stamina; however, if he was not working on his football skills outside of Track also, the other freshmen would pass him up (regardless of his speed gains). He says the talk I gave him really helped him and I'm happy to say that he decided to stay in Track going on to compete on our JV 4x1 team. He also made Varsity football during the tryouts over summer. In a way, my experience with Devyn taught me a lot. It’s easy to assume leaders are born and not created, however what I have learned is that true leaders are often a product of circumstance. I was put in the right “circumstance” (being in Track as well as a Link Crew Leader) in order to affect another. I believe leadership is the ability to “step up” when you are needed. In this situation I was needed and because of my choice, I was able to positively influence someone and guide them on their most ideal path. \n\nEvery person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  \n\nI started dancing when I was seven in a Hip Hop crew, however around the time I was nine one of my teachers who we called “Junior” was arrested and the other being his wife (Chantelle) was unable to continue. Jr really was one of my biggest motivators in dance and after he was arrested I just didn’t have the spirit to dance anymore. I recently started up again because of my friend Kern, and finding my style and “groove” has been a tough experience. My style before (when my body was smaller and lighter) was more quick and technical, however now that I am bigger and lankier it has been almost impossible to go back to how I was. Recently I have joined my school’s African dance/step team and  taken up Bboying (also known as breakdancing).  \n\nBecause of breaking I was able to connect with fellow breakers at a benefit show my school dance team put on for a fellow breaker named Rocky that had recently passed. At the benefit show, many of his old breaking crews/students came to dance and pay tribute. Together we put on a show that not only touched Rocky’s family, but even those in the crowd that didn’t even know Rocky. At the show as I watched onlookers breakdown as we danced and saw Rocky’s girlfriend, who hadn’t smiled since his death, get excited and happy, I had a realization. Dance, like language, was meant to connect us. All our pains, cheers, thoughts, and differences are shared. I could feel the crowd connect on a level with me and my fellow dancers. I have rarely felt as happy as I did that night. That night I really felt like world peace is possible if we just learned to understand each other like everyone in that gym understood each other. I’m glad I danced, because for one night I was able to help alleviate the pain and sadness of bboy Rockybot’s death. \n\nBecause of dance I don’t worry as much as others because as a dancer I don’t treat people like others do. In the dance community you don’t worry about race, religion, appearance, or history. I am who I am through how I dance and no one can take that away from me.         \n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n\nDuring the summer after my Freshman year I was given the opportunity by my counselor to pilot a new summer chemistry class. Having anticipated that I might not get to take AP Chemistry during the regular school year, I took the opportunity of piloting the new summer chemistry class the summer of my freshman year. Even though this was a great opportunity, the summer chemistry class hardly prepared me for what was to come. Although I was unable to fully grasp all of the rules and intricacies of Chemistry in the short time I was given in the summer class, I was able to learn how to use T-charts, the main elements used on the periodic table, how to read a periodic table, and most importantly how covalent and ionic bonds are formed. When I started AP Chemistry during the school year I did not understand concepts which I was supposed to have already covered in regular chemistry. Also, in a sense, I was a sophomore in junior/senior class, so there was really no other student in the class that I could bravely seek help from. I could tell the teacher was becoming frustrated with my lack of knowledge. I now see this adverse experience as a blessing. If I had not taken the summer chemistry class, I would never have been able to take AP Chemistry in high school and I would never have found out that I have the ability to teach myself. In the end I actually did end up passing both the AP Chemistry class and the AP test. \n\n        Looking back now The circumstances of the class helped me be both more outgoing self-driven., I was able to make friends with juniors and seniors that I still connect with today. I also had to teach myself and get my work done while also trying to learn from the teacher herself.\n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nBack when I was a freshman and even before that, basketball was my main focus.  However the injury to my knee changed all that. An MRI showed that the Articular Cartilage protecting my femur had torn off from forced trauma and now not only was their an unprotected spot that was allowing my femur to be damaged, but I also had a big piece of cartilage floating around in my knee scraping everywhere. Watching my dreams crumble around me was not an instantaneous thing. It started off as a shock to me, then my naivety set in making me believe that everything would return to the way it was. Healing was never a simple process for me, dates kept being pushed back. Two months turned  into 8 months, and on top of that rehabilitation didn’t go as planned, it ended up being almost a year before I could even jog again. I became depressed having no idea with what I was to do with myself. The hardest points were when I would watch other people play basketball and think that life wasn’t worth living anymore. School became extremely difficult because I literally lost the energy to do anything. When that would happen I would lay on the floor for hours staring at the ceiling. I think the hardest part of the injury was not the injury itself, but my mother's attempts at encouragement. She told me sorry and that I should move on, but never that I could do it. Unable to find encouragement in others I had to really look deep into myself. Regardless of what the injury did to me, it did teach me to slow down. The life of a child athlete is a fast-paced one, however my knee injury changed my course. It was difficult however it allowed me to figure what I’m allowed to do and taught me that sometimes as humans we need to take time to “heal” whether it's emotionally, physically, mentally, or spiritually. It taught me that if you want encouragement, you have to close your eyes and summon it for yourself. It took me till the end of my sophomore year to realize this, and through this school has gotten easier and I have been able to learn so much more.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"waitlisted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":221,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c81-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"The thought of achieving any sort of higher education has often been an overlooked, or just plain disregarded idea in my family for generations. I’ve come from a long line of ancestors that labored throughout life to make ends meet, often leaving school early to take up a job and support a struggling family. Only one of my grandparents even attended high school, let alone graduated. Both of my parents made it through, albeit barely passing, yet went straight to work, abandoning any idea of studying further due to poor finances, poor academics and a generally poor attitude to the sort of idea.\n\nBut I knew early on in life that they expected more of me, that I was supposed to serve as the outlier to the norm in my family and end the long line of subpar students, that I would be the one to further my education, and go on to do something more meaningful with my life.\n\nThe thought scared the hell out of me. And to be honest, it still does.\n\nBecause the thing is, I don’t know where I want to go from here. All my life I’ve never been able to give a response to that oft-asked question, “So Joe, what do you want to be when you’re grown up?” Had my grandparents been confronted with that same query, they couldn’t have answered simply because they had no choice in the matter. A Great Depression, a family of seven or a draft notice from the Army were among some of the more pressing issues at hand. They couldn’t answer because they had no other options. I can’t answer because I have too many.\n\nYet I want to answer that question. And I guess that’s part of the reason I’m writing this essay. I’ve accepted the fact that, right now, I simply don’t know who I’m going to be, and that it’s going to take some time before I can finally look around and think to myself, “I want to spend my life doing this.” But I’ve come to realize that college can serve as the catalyst that gets me there, the place where I can begin to learn and see the world on my own terms, and take advantage of the choices I’ve been blessed with the ability to make, when the same couldn’t be said about the generations that came before me. I know that with the freedom to study what I want to learn, I can pursue a career born, not out of necessity, but out of choice. I’ve been given the opportunity to change not just myself, but the attitude that my own family will have toward higher education, and the doors that it can open in their own lives.\n\nNevertheless, the thought of being the first in my family to attend college remains daunting. At times, I feel tasked with a responsibility of near-prophetic proportions, as if I’m The One to finally bring about an end to the decades-old struggle of “a lineage gone unlearned.” I’ve come to accept it as a challenge. And the more I think about it, the more I see it as something gratifying. It’s taken years of trial, but I will emerge as the outlier for my family. I will finally end the cycle for us.\n\nThe fear remains, but I’ve come to realize that the pride outweighs.","prompt":"","college":"Manhattan College","year":2015,"status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"","image":743,"date":"2018-11-11T06:37:27.616Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c82-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"I am here because my great-grandfather tied his shoelace. It was World War I, and he was a Montenegrin fighting in the American army in France. His fellow soldiers surged across the field, but he paused for the briefest of moments because his laces had come undone. Those ahead of him were blown to bits. Years later, as Montenegro was facing a civil war, the communists came to his home. His village was small, and he knew the men who knocked on his door. But this familiarity meant nothing, for when they saw him they thought of the word America, stamped across a land where the poor were stripped of their rights and where the fierce and volatile Balkan temper would not do.\n\nAs his neighbors ransacked his home, his wife had thrust his good pair of shoes at him.\n\n“Take them,” she had urged. “Wear them.”\n\nTara CicicBut he did not, for he knew that he could not run. I also cannot run, but I wear my new shoes with great ease and comfort. I wear the secret guilt, the belief in equality, the obsession with culture, and the worship of rational thinking and education that becomes the certain kind of American that I am. None of these things are costumes. I believe in and feel them all sincerely, but they are not who I am. They may be a part, but I can say with certainty that they are not all.\n\nI was born in Belgrade and Serbian was my first language, but these things seem nearly inconsequential when compared to the number of years that I’ve spent in America and the fact that English is by far my superior tongue. We visit every two or three years or so. Everybody is there, my entire collection of cousins and aunts and grandparents neatly totted up in a scattering of villages and cities, arms open with the promise of a few sneaky sips of rakia and bites of kajmak. I love them, I truly do. I love the flat roof on my grandparents’ home, the familiar sounds of the cicadas, the cows that they had when I was 7, and even the goats that I have not met yet. But they are not me, those things. They are something else.\n\nTake a few bounds away from my immediate family, and I do not know anyone’s names. Somebody is always falling ill, or drinking too much, or making trouble for themselves. We speak of them sometimes, or pity them, but we do not go to their weddings or funerals. And yet I feel worried, not for them, but for myself. The Serbs and Montenegrins are people of complicated histories, and as I watch the documentaries my father made during the civil war there, I am gripped with fear and fascination. Those strange people can be so hateful. They cry and beat their hearts at the thought of Serbian loss in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. This kind of nationalism makes me cringe. I do not want to be that way. But is there not something beautiful in that kind of passion and emotion? What does it say of me that I sometimes cannot help but romanticize something I know to be destructive and oppressive? This is why I worry.\n\nThey are not me, I tell myself, and I am right. But can they not be just a part? Can they not be a tiny sliver, or maybe even a sizeable chunk, comparable even to the American in me? Must I relegate them to nothing at all?

At 9, I remember how I used to lounge on the couch and watch Disney cartoons on the sideways refrigerator of a TV implanted in a small cave in the wall. At 12, I remember family photographs of the Spanish countryside hanging in every room. At 14, I remember vacuuming each foot of carpet in the massive house and folding pastel shirts fresh out of the dryer.\n\nI loved the house. I loved the way the windows soaked the house with light, a sort of bleach against any gloom. I loved how I could always find a book or magazine on any flat surface.\n\nBut the vacuum my mother used wasn’t ours. We never paid for cable. The photographs weren’t of my family. The carpet I vacuumed I only saw once a week, and the pastel shirts I folded I never wore. The house wasn’t mine. My mother was only the cleaning lady, and I helped.\n\nMy mother and father had come as refugees almost twenty years ago from the country of Moldova. My mother worked numerous odd jobs, but once I was born she decided she needed to do something different. She put an ad in the paper advertising house cleaning, and a couple, both professors, answered. They became her first client, and their house became the bedrock of our sustenance. Economic recessions came and went, but my mother returned every Monday, Friday and occasional Sunday.\n\nShe spends her days in teal latex gloves, guiding a blue Hoover vacuum over what seems like miles of carpet. All the mirrors she’s cleaned could probably stack up to be a minor Philip Johnson skyscraper. This isn’t new for her. The vacuums and the gloves might be, but the work isn’t. In Moldova, her family grew gherkins and tomatoes. She spent countless hours kneeling in the dirt, growing her vegetables with the care that professors advise their protégés, with kindness and proactivity. Today, the fruits of her labor have been replaced with the suction of her vacuum.\n\nThe professors’ home was a telescope to how the other (more affluent) half lived. They were rarely ever home, so I saw their remnants: the lightly crinkled New York Times sprawled on the kitchen table, the overturned, half-opened books in their overflowing personal library, the TV consistently left on the National Geographic channel. I took these remnants as a celebrity-endorsed path to prosperity. I began to check out books from the school library and started reading the news religiously.\n\nTheir home was a sanctuary for my dreams. It was there I, as a glasses-wearing computer nerd, read about a mythical place called Silicon Valley in Bloomberg Businessweek magazines. It was there, as a son of immigrants, that I read about a young senator named Barack Obama, the child of an immigrant, aspiring to be the president of the United States. The life that I saw through their home showed me that an immigrant could succeed in America, too. Work could be done with one’s hands and with one’s mind. It impressed on me a sort of social capital that I knew could be used in America. The professors left me the elements to their own success, and all my life I’ve been trying to make my own reaction.\n\nUltimately, the suction of the vacuum is what sustains my family. The squeal of her vacuum reminds me why I have the opportunity to drive my squealing car to school. I am where I am today because my mom put an enormous amount of labor into the formula of the American Dream. It’s her blue Hoover vacuums that hold up the framework of my life. Someday, I hope my diploma can hold up the framework of hers.","prompt":"","college":"University of Minnesota","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"Jonathan Ababiy","email":"","country":"United States","state":"Minnesota","featured":"true","image":915,"date":"2018-11-16T21:04:11.769Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c84-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"On the day my first novel was rejected, I was baking pies. Or rather, I was gathering the necessary stamina for our church’s annual pie sale. Ten hours of rolling crusts and peeling apples and kneading butter and sugar into the crumble topping, all the while drowning in the cinnamon air, surrounded by near-literal mountains of pies that we were forbidden to touch. (It was, I think, our pastor’s method of drilling the meaning of temptation into heads — he always preached about Eden the following Sunday.) I sat on my couch and counted the minutes until the agony of pie-making, (almost) forgetting the novel that was currently with the acquisitions board of one of the biggest publishing houses in the world.\n\nAmy ZhangTo be fair, I hadn’t known that the acquisitions meeting would be held that day. I did know that two — two! — senior editors wanted to make all of my impossible dreams come true. I knew that the marketing and sales people had already looked over my manuscript — something that usually happened post-contract. I knew the meeting had been pushed back twice already by an unsympathetic hurricane that had left downtown Manhattan under several feet of water. I knew this was it. This had to be it. It was my turn.\n\nI had slogged through the query trenches in search of an agent. I had collected enough rejection letters to wallpaper my room. I had found an agent who hadn’t run away when I finally told her that I was 15, who loved my story almost as much as I did, who submitted it and lured two — two! — senior editors to take a risk on it.\n\nHello, future? I’m ready for my happily ever after. Love, Amy.\n\nPhone call from my agent. Sweaty palms and dizziness, a tap of a shaking finger to a smudged screen. Small talk and stalling. A sigh and, at last, the news, that the publisher had a similar novel on her list and vetoed the editors. That there was no heat in the flooded building and they had rejected everything and had gone home early. Stomach in throat, swallow. False laugh, assurances of next time. End call. Tears.\n\nHello, Amy? Sucks, doesn’t it? Love, the future.\n\nIt sucked so monumentally that I bought a pie and ate it in one sitting.\n\nIt’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.

With all the demands and commitments that life can put on a person, it is sometimes easy to lose the essence of “the me”… whether it’s a mother trying to balance a job, a family, a house, shopping, meals and a husband; or a student with the pressure of school, sports, clubs, community service and friends to name a few. Where is the time for hobbies, interests and self-exploration? Where is the time to get to know “the me”?\n\nLooking back at freshman year, my life was like a cityscape, busy and vibrant.  I was just another young soul eager to meet life’s challenges. I proudly reached certain goals that defined the student I wanted to be: made it into the science institute: check, varsity soccer: check, a nationally ranked soccer team: check, clubs: check, job: check, volunteer work: check. Am I forgetting anything? Sleep, food, friends, downtime… Who needs it? It turns out the answer is ME!\n\nIn this busy canvas, life’s commitments became the artist and I became just a stroke of paint getting stretched too thin. I felt tired, over committed and ineffective.\n\nI knew I would need to regain control to balance the colors within my portrait. Sometimes when we put in so much time and effort but do not see the desired results, it is hard not to see this as a personal failure. That is how I felt by the end of sophomore year. I decided to scrap the old canvas and begin anew. Junior year, I became the artist once more, and I chose the palette of my interests. I left the science institute, changed travel soccer teams, and chose volunteer work that I really enjoyed. With a less crowded landscape, there was so much more focus and time for “the me” to emerge.\n\nNewfound interests and talents became a part of my life that I never had time for before. I was able to keep the original colors on my canvas: school, soccer and everything that made me, me before. However I was able to add new ones such as art, photography and become a more out outgoing individual. I was passionate about everything I was doing and much more effective in each aspect I took part in. Stepping back and looking at the big picture taught me to make decisions that were best for me, and not for those around me. I am able to create a picture that, to me, is a masterpiece even if others see it as painted colors.\n\nThe emergence of “the me” is a life long work in progress as we are always adding color, dimension, and interests as we grow. Sometimes by choosing the colors of our picture more carefully, more depth can be added to the picture that clarifies “the me”. Whether you choose to create your canvas as a cityscape, a peaceful park, or a leaf blowing in the wind, be sure to be the artist that defines the colors of your “ME”.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":"","status":"accepted","author":"Nina Brennan","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":305,"date":"2018-11-21T22:04:11.530Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c86-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Bowing down to the porcelain god, I emptied the contents of my stomach. Foaming at the mouth, I was ready to pass out. My body couldn’t stop shaking as I gasped for air, and the room started spinning.\n\nTen minutes prior, I had been eating dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, drinking chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in it, because when I was two we found out that I am deathly allergic to them. When the waitress replied no, I went for it. Suddenly I started scratching my neck, feeling the hives that had started to form. I rushed to the restroom to throw up because my throat was itchy and I felt a weight on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, which prevented me from taking anything but shallow breaths. I was fighting the one thing that is meant to protect me and keep me alive – my own body.\n\nAt five years old, I couldn’t comprehend what had happened. All I knew was that I felt sick, and I was waiting for my mom to give me something to make it better. I thought my parents were superheroes; surely they would be able to make well again. But I became scared when I heard the fear in their voices as they rushed me to the ER.\n\nAfter that incident, I began to fear. I became scared of death, eating, and even my own body. As I grew older, I became paranoid about checking food labels and I avoided eating if I didn’t know what was in the food. I knew what could happen if I ate one wrong thing, and I wasn’t willing to risk it for a snack. Ultimately, that fear turned into resentment; I resented my body for making me an outsider.\n\nIn the years that followed, this experience and my regular visits to my allergy specialist inspired me to become an allergy specialist. Even though I was probably only ten at the time, I wanted to find a way to help kids like me. I wanted to find a solution so that nobody would have to feel the way I did; nobody deserves to feel that pain, fear, and resentment. As I learned more about the medical world, I became more fascinated with the body’s immune responses, specifically, how a body reacts to allergens. This past summer, I took a month-long course on human immunology at Stanford University. I learned about the different mechanisms and cells that our bodies use in order to fight off pathogens. My desire to major in biology in college has been stimulated by my fascination with the human body, its processes, and the desire to find a way to help people with allergies. I hope that one day I can find a way to stop allergic reactions or at least lessen the symptoms, so that children and adults don’t have to feel the same fear and bitterness that I felt.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":994,"date":"2018-11-11T06:07:22.124Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c87-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"My head was spinning, my hands were bleeding, and my lungs desperately needed more air. The air was filled with the shouts of men dying and steel clashing with steel. To my left were two young men, no more than 18 years old, at each other’s throats. To my right an old man lay dead, missing an arm. My men were pouring out of the breach in full retreat. Death surrounded me as I summoned every ounce of my courage and shouted out that desperate ultimatum to my dying brethren, “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with our English dead!”\n\nThen reality came crashing down. “No, no you’re doing it all wrong.” I blinked, and instead of a bloody battlefield in front of me there was nothing more than a nearly empty auditorium. The sole occupant of the auditorium was a tall, bald, British man with a terrifyingly condescending demeanor. He was my Shakespeare coach. The most minuscule mistake never escaped his notice. “There’s no chance in hell I would ever fight for you,” he said. “Do it again.” I went offstage and tried to repaint the picture.\n\nI emerged inflamed with the drive for victory.

I was here to prove to myself that I could accomplish something momentous.\n\nI was born with two speech impediments. I was a shy kid, with a crooked smile, who couldn’t pronounce any words correctly. Participating in theatre was the last thing anyone expected of me. Yet I wanted to sway crowds with my voice, make them cry, laugh and shout for joy. I was a terrified 10-year-old the first time I stepped on stage, and equally frightened moments before I finally performed at Lincoln Center. I walked slowly to my position full of fear, but when the spotlight hit my face, there was no trepidation, only a calmness and quiet determination. In that moment all the long hours of struggle fell into place. I had already accomplished what I had set out to do before my final performance. Just being there, having worked as hard as I had, made all the worry dissipate. It was just me and the light.\n\nIn that earlier moment of failure, I couldn’t see that light, or even imagine it. My brain was in a fog; I couldn’t think. As I sat there and the lights in the theatre clicked off one by one, the setting sun cast a beam of orange sunlight directly center stage. I pretended to watch myself perform in that light, pacing to and fro, shouting heroically to my men and charging headlong into battle, into victory. I looked back down at the memento. Then something clicked. Henry V never lost hope and neither would I. So I went once more to the stage.","prompt":"","college":"Hamillton College","year":"","status":"accepted","author":"Tommy Bowden","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"","image":200,"date":"2018-11-17T21:09:17.707Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c88-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"What have you done to make your school or community a better place?\n\nI was selected out of twenty students to represent my school for a week at a summer camp called RYLA. I was very nervous attending the camp as I soon found out I was one of four African American people at the camp. Being as optimistic as possible, I absorbed as much from the camp as possible. I learned from the camp that positivity, confidence and perseverance are key tools to leading a successful life. Taking my three lessons back to my home in Sacramento, I went to volunteer at a basketball facility. I was put in the situation of working with an autistic young boy named Emmanuel. Emmanuel played basketball to release some of his energy and anger from home. Working with Emmanuel was important to m, being that I have my own special needs brother and I know it takes a little longer for people with special needs to learn. Emmanuel took longer to understand the new drills we did daily. For me it took a lot of patience to help Emmanuel because I’m familiar with playing fast paced basketball. Taking what I learned from the RYLA camp, I tried to instill confidence and positivity in him. I always encouraged him to keep trying at every drill as hard as he could and made sure to gave him positive feedback. When Emmanuel made a mistake, I ensured him it was okay to make mistakes and focused on the solution to fix future mistakes. Working with Emmanuel has motivated me to invest in my own sports facility when I get older. I want my facility to focus on special needs children and helping them get active, because many times special needs children never get the chance to participate in sports because of their lack of confidence. By working with Emmanuel, I was finally able to understand some of the problems and thinking processes my own brother has by seeing it from a different perspective. Working with Emmanuel was a life changing and humbling experience.\n\nDescribe an example of you leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n\n \n\nIn eleventh grade, my leadership class lost control. The new teacher running the class was poorly organized, and many of the students were seniors who joined for the looks of it and not interested in actually doing the required work. It was clear from the start we were going to have problems. During homecoming week, the events were not being successfully executed, so I took matters into my own hands. I explained to my leadership class that we had lost respect and we needed to prove our worth. I encouraged my leadership class to set their differences aside and think about school as a whole. The day of the rally, not enough decorations were made, so I broke the class into groups and each had their own jobs. During rally practice, I made sure everything was fully executed from the games, to performers, to transition times. In the end, the entire school gym was decorated from top to bottom. I hosted the rally, and the entire school had a great time. I received positive feedback from the administration. I also had to step up and actually address the problems while finding solutions to fix them. From that point forward, I greatly improved the efficiency of the class and quality of our events for the rest of the year. I learned that sometimes not all people have the same drive as I do, but it’s important to focus on my job, delegate specific jobs, and work hard.\n\nDescribe your favorite academic subject and explain how it influenced you? \n\n         \n\nChange will only come if we as future leaders gain roles of positions that will lead to greater change. A future in business will allow me to create direct avenues of change and become one of the most successful business owners in the world. Throughout high school, I was exposed to classes in which  I learned about types of businesses, running businesses, and marketing products. Beyond the theory, the most important things I learn from taking business classes has come from interacting with my classmates as we run an actual business. Throughout these experiences, I learned that patience is essential because not everyone will work as efficiently as I do. Patience has played a strong role in helping me to ensure that our programs and initiatives run smoothly. Working with different students showed me that working with friends is not always smart and stereotyping others limits what their potential. Taking business has definitely motivated me more to work in the business field because it was exciting to work on an actual business where we design and sell t-shirts for our school community. I am the VP of Sales and Marketing, and I love it because I am a competitive person who is strong at communicating and advertising.  I narrowed the areas of business I want to work in to marketing, finance, and management. I have also become interested in working with international business because it is fun to explore new people and their cultures. Business is definitely a challenge, since I was not aware of the amount of work it took to maintain a businesses until I was running one of my own. I was awakened to the fact that many people run their businesses for money and not to help better society. Personally, I want to run multiple businesses that help the community. Giving back to the community through business is important because without the community, businesses would not be able to function. Additionally, I would like to help underprivileged and underrepresented communities because I know that business opportunities play a huge part in transforming low income communities. \n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nIt seemed as if misery and misfortune began to arise as I entered my sophomore year. My grandmother suddenly got very sick very quickly and my brother was struggling with his ongoing mental illness. Due to my grandmother’s illness, my mom had to shift most of her time to taking care of my grandmother and making sure she received the proper care. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away a couple of weeks before my AP World History test. My brother’s schizophrenia, affecting his behavior in new ways everyday, was hard to balance. Between visiting my brother forty-five minutes away from home and making sure my grandmother was in good care an hour and a half from home, life seemed to completely turn upside down. At this point in my life, it looked as if it was over, but I realized that life still goes on. This was one of the most difficult adversities I had to experience which caused my effort and perseverance in class to diminish. There were days when I did not want to be at school. I did all my research on other high schools in Sacramento, as if leaving my school would solve all my problems. I learned the hard way that trying to leave the school would not solve any of my problems at all. Finally, my AP test and finals came, and I performed poorly on both. I was devastated. However, my sophomore year prepared me to successfully transition into my junior year, because I improved as a student both mentally and socially. I took the initiative to enroll for more AP classes and also made a commitment to score well in them. After my hard work, I finished my junior year with a 3.86 unweighted and a 4.46 weighted. I passed my AP U.S. History exam with a five, and by signing up for the many programs, I was able to participate in all of them. Everything started with one failure that allowed the hardest year of my life to lead to the best year of my life.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"waitlisted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":225,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c89-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Tunnel Vision\n\nAttempting to juke people like an NFL running back, I slithered my way through the tunnel to the A-Train on 42nd Street during rush hour. I often try to block out the hectic surroundings by isolating myself in music, but I can never seem to get out of the real life time-lapse. In photography, a time-lapse is a technique at which the frame rate is lower than that used to view the sequence, thus, when the sequence is played at normal speed, it gives the effect that time is moving faster, or lapsing. In a Manhattan subway tunnel, a real life time-lapse gives the illusion that thousands are moving around you in one single moment. Luckily, that afternoon, the frame rate was higher than the actual visual sequence.\n\nJoe PucciThe crowd shoved their way toward the platform as the screeching train echoed through the underpass. The doors opened and I pushed my way toward the already full train. After five seconds, I began to worry, fearing that the door would close and I would be stuck longer in the blistering, underground cave. The tall, brunette girl in front of me inched her way over the gap between the rusted train and the yellow platform, but one misstep turned my time-lapse upside down.\n\nIn slow motion, one vertebra at a time, she fell through the gap toward the tracks as the train doors closed. I slipped my hands out of my skinny jeans and reached under her arms as her head neared the platform. I hoisted her up and the sensor doors reopened as we entered the train. I threw my headphones around my shoulders, clumsily turned down my embarrassing music, and asked if she was okay. My pause had lasted for all of about two seconds. No one on the train noticed, not even her mom.\n\nThis isn’t a heroic tale or a love story, although I felt like it was at the moment. I felt like I had done something much bigger than me, and I also felt like this beautiful girl and I would naturally connect over what just happened. But this wasn’t the case. Instead, I checked on her, smiled, and around 10 seconds after my “lifesaving” moment, immediately isolated myself back into the music. I couldn’t bring out my inner-confidence. I simply stood there thinking of something to say, only to be left mute.\n\nIt’s easy to say what you want to do, but nearly impossible to bring yourself to do all those things. Life is about taking risks, not about conforming and hiding behind invisible walls. I tend not to struggle with personal adventure; I’ve jumped off 50-foot cliffs and rode the biggest roller coaster dozens of times; however, I do fear being judged and messing up when stepping toward the plate. Life’s too short to live with regret though. My life wasn’t dramatically transposed during this incident, but the things I didn’t do are a constant reminder to stomp on the shortlist of opportunities I’m given. For that girl, she was a vertebra away from not having another chance. When that moment comes for me, I don’t want to have any regrets. I look back at this brief moment with such rue because I feel that my time-lapse was flipped for a reason, yet I couldn’t grasp the opportunity.\n\nThe music was a place to buy myself more time, a place to quickly think about the next move. But the top-half of the sandglass was empty and the girl got off at the next stop, roughly 30 seconds later. My eyes were fixed on her as she left the train and headed for the stairs. The train began to move when she glanced through the window and mouthed the words, “Thank you.”","prompt":"","college":"Hamillton College","year":2003,"status":"accepted","author":"Joe Pucci","email":"","country":"United States","state":"New York","featured":"true","image":990,"date":"2018-11-17T21:26:16.932Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c8a-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"In Spheres of Justice, political theorist Michael Walzer says, \"Education expresses what \n\n is, perhaps, our deepest wish: to continue, to go on, to persist in the face of time.\" It was \n\n sitting in the Radiation Treatment Center at MD Anderson that I began to understand \n\n and appreciate not just the importance of education, but the profound effects it holds as \n\n an institution. I was in seventh grade when my mother was diagnosed with breast \n\n cancer, and I remember her telling me that after her diagnosis, the only place she felt \n\n understood was in the halls of her treatment facility. It was not the solidarity from other \n\n patients that comforted her, but the institution of education and the dedication to \n\n progress surrounding her disease. \n\n This early appreciation of knowledge led me to taking up extracurricular education as a \n\n regimented hobby. I was encouraged to develop interests in many disparate fields - I \n\n was free to take apart household electronics, connecting and disconnecting more wires \n\n than seen in most Mission Impossible films; my aunt's home recorder became the \n\n framing for the emotional angst of an adolescent; the backyard pool fluctuated between \n\n a relaxing summer activity and a marine biology experiment. Even as I unearthed only \n\n basic understandings of different fields, I developed an appreciation for the nuances of \n\n formal education - the camaraderie of sharing a common focus, the environment \n\n conducive to curiosity and welcoming of change, and the perpetually developing \n\n parlance that seeks to bound discoveries of the past to the crop it hopes to yield in the \n\n future. \n\n When my mother passed away at the end of my junior year, my plans shifted \n\n dramatically. My younger sister had only just turned ten years old, and my father had \n\n been forced into an early retirement from a disability, so I took a job and held in \n\n abeyance plans for university. Upon graduation, I worked in my hometown while \n\n enrolling in classes at my local college. A year and a half later, I was presented the \n\n opportunity to spend time in New York City making a documentary series. After a period \n\n that had felt like a stagnation in my life, I decided to take some time off from school and \n\n dive into the unknown. \n\n During this process, I was able to immerse myself in an eclectic culture that seemed \n\n foreign to my hometown in southern Mississippi and join or create local groups \n\n dedicated to fields of study I had been interested in for so long — a debate club that \n\n developed into a political discussion podcast for Millennials; a volunteer programming \n\n group for open-source community projects; a language studies club that promoted \n\n ideas of bridging the shared human experience over the filters of language. It was my \n\n favorite project, teaching writing and music (eventually recording an album and \n\n producing a music video) at the Jersey City Boys & Girls Club, which was most \n\n incendiary to concentrating my mind towards transferring. From an inverted perspective \n\n I saw the inspiring effects of the collection of ambition and the focus of talent; I saw \n\n passion produce creation. \n\n Education does more than subvert ignorance or dissolve fear, it paints a picture of the \n\n human endeavor and offers a palette with which one has the opportunity to contribute. \n\n Knowledge as a collective is comforting, it is inspiring, and it allows one to refine the \n\n subtleties of human understanding. It is through transferring that I hope to fully \n\n immerse myself into the education system that I have admired for so long, but of which \n\n I have not yet had the opportunity to take full advantage.

I would pay for SAT II exams, again.\n\nEven with fee waivers, applying to college is pricey. Sending test scores to more than 4 colleges cost money, AP exams fees are reduced but not obliterated, and I’d love to meet the genius who thought of charging a fee for applying for financial aid.

Being a senior at Stuy is much, much worse. So far, this year’s classes have demanded about $270 total in textbooks, workbooks, art supplies, and other expenses. When my teachers ask whether anyone will have trouble paying for their supplies, no one speaks up and an awkward silence ensues.\n\nWhile academic costs have mostly been waived, high school memories are not priceless.

It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.\n\nAt five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.\n\nIt was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.\n\nIt began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.\n\nIn the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.\n\nThen, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.\n\nInterestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world.\n\nBut the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin.\n\nI want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation.\n\nI think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\n\nToday, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":292,"date":"2018-11-11T06:01:51.210Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c8d-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  \n\nA meaningful example of where I displayed a  leadership is when I positively influenced my peers during a college tour to Atlanta. To rally my fellow students to complete their UC applications, I encouraged  my friends to diligently work to improve their applications day and night. My peers and I would edit each other’s applications. As some students tend to be irresponsible, many of the students failed to submit their essays before the deadline. I took the initiative to contact the students who had not submitted their essays and requested that they send them in immediately. When it came to the day to find out who had got in, two of my friends and I ended up getting in. We ended up being three of the twenty-four students from across the country that got selected. This is one of the most impactful moments I have been able to create. Taking the initiative, ensuring that my peers were given a chance to be accepted into the program, proved to be a extremely rewarding experience.\n\nWhen it comes to being a leader, I’m the type that will always try to give you that extra push for greatness. Before helping my friends for the college tour, I had many different leadership encounters with other students at my high school.I push my teammates at Football practice to do their best, so when it comes to game day all of that hard work will show and pay off. I always encourage my peers to excel in  school. When they don’t understand something with their school work, I am  always there for them, because i want to see them graduate and succeed in life just like me. \n\nDescribe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\n\nAfter having these different encounters with my friends, it really showed me how much of a leader I can be in my community,and how much of a influence I have on others. As the years go by, I can see what a great leader I am becoming, \n\nI grew up homeless and had little to nothing, in and out of homeless shelters and forced to wear the same ragged outfits to school every week.  My Brother, Sister, and I were eating rice and beans every night and whatever else my mom can get with the little money she had. My mother and step- father struggled to make ends meet. When we had to leave the homeless shelters, we would have to go to run down hotels where it was so cold when I woke up in the morning the water i left out was frozen solid. \n\nThrough all my trials and tribulations  I was still able to remain at the  top of my class, because I felt that  my education should come first. I didn't want my upbringing to be an excuse to why I couldn't succeed I did not allow my circumstances to limit my expectations and aspirations. I didn't want my future Family living like I did; not knowing where they would be living the next day. So when I got to the shelter or when I was on the bus I  would study and work on homework, and help my younger siblings so they could know how important and powerful knowledge is. I believe having a high level of education is greater than money, and can get you anywhere you want in life. This had an huge affect on my academic achievements, because if I was able to be top of my class then I can do it now. Today I am on track to being a Student Athlete Valedictorian. \n\nAll in all, although we may not be able to control the obstacles we face in life, we must strive for excellence by holding firmly to our goals, beliefs, and aspirations. \n\nWhat have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  \n\nSomething I have done to make my community a better place was going to the local Elementary school to mentor underprivileged and disadvantaged 2nd graders who resided in my community. The kids and I built  very strong bonds, because most of them grew up in the same situation as I did. Many of them were raised in broken families, violent homes and communities full of drugs and weaponry. Many of them struggled to find an avenue to escape the conditions to which we were subject for a way out, just as I did.\n\nDuring their recess, I would pull kids aside and talk to them and see what problems they were going through.Many of them confided in me and knew that I would be there to consult them.  For most of the kids I was the only person they could talk, trust, and relate to. One of my mentees was named Ryon. Before I started mentoring him he would fight everyday in response to his experiences as a bully victim. ,By the end of the school year he was no longer fighting,  because I was able to mediate  a conversation between Ryon and the bullies. . Ryon stopped getting kicked out of class, and began volunteering in class more, as he became more eager to learn new class material.\n\nI had the opportunity to witness Ryon transform into a responsible, diligent and hard working student that became one of the top students in his class.I will continue to mentor and serve as many students as possible in order to ensure that children of disadvantaged and underprivileged communities have access to resources that will allow one to succeed despite one's unbearable circumstances. There are so many other kids just like Ryon who desire to learn develop and succeed but lack the resources and support to do so. I will stand in the gap and continue to guide students into successful paths. \n\nBeyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?\n\nGrowing up in an all white school, I was the black  kid  who was treated like the “other” in the room. I got little help from teachers and told that I wouldn’t make it to college. I was told that  I was going to be held back and sent to another school.  Instead of letting this discourage me, I used that to push me         whenever I thought of quitting. The next school year I was passing all of my state tests and ended up on honor roll. I believe this separates me from others because when life begins to get hard I always think back to where I came from and how I have to keep excelling so my younger siblings know they can make it out of poverty. I believe if I don't lead by example for my siblings, they won't excel and believe in themselves. \n\nA times when I had a big challenge in front of me and let in discourage me was when my football team played Stagg High School. The game was back and forth, and a lot of players on my team were getting injured. During the second quarter, I had hurt my ankle along with the other running back who had hurt his ankle as well. With us being short on player I went and changed my cleats and got back in the game. With us being down by two touchdowns many of my teammates felt discouraged and ready to go home, but it was my responsibility to encourage those on my team. I’ve always been the high spirited person who will never give up no matter the circumstances. After talking to different members of the team and getting them pumped up , when the fourth quarter came we went down and took the lead once again by a touchdown. When the game ended we walking out with the win that had carried with us for the rest of the season.\n\nThese are just two prime examples of when I faced difficult challenges and didn’t let them discourage me, but instead was able to fight through them despite my circumstances. Throughout my life I always said “We can’t change the cards god has dealt us in life, so make the best out of the hand we’ve been dealt.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2016,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":43,"date":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c8e-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge.

I worked as many hours as possible in order to be able to help my mom pay the bills.On the days I did not work I would baby sit Kasandra, so my mom could take an extra shift at work since we could not afford a babysitter. We did not have family around either to help out with taking care of Kasandra, my little sister. Balancing work, school, and babysitting became challenging. I lost hope in believing I was going to be successful in school. I felt alone because no one in my family was there to support me with school. Only six people in my family had graduated from high school and none of them were able to help. I sought for help in my school. During lunch, I would stay in for tutoring with different teachers to be able to keep up with all my school work. I joined Trio for after school tutoring on the days I did not babysit or work. I excelled at school with the help of tutoring. I struggle with family and school as well and have difficulty focusing in school. I wanted to help others because without help I would not have been able to overcome my challenge, so I started tutoring others during lunch.\n\nDescribe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n\nMy favorite academic subject is Spanish. The reason being Spanish was my first language. Spanish not only became a way to connect with family, but it also became part of my identity. I wanted to be able to help others who did not have the opportunity to learn English or Spanish. My junior year of high school, I joined Spanglish Club. I wanted to be able to help others in school, as I do at home by translating for family members. In Spanglish Club, I had the opportunity to teach English to students who did not have the opportunity to learn English in their family or school. Also, I taught Spanish to Latinx students who were English speakers only. I taught Spanish to break the barrier and distance of not being able to embrace and be part of their own culture. During the Summer, I took an Ethnic Studies at Evergreen Valley College. The course was to learn about Mexican/ American studies. This helped me to learn more about where I come from and to fully understand my identity. Spanish to me is more than just a subject, it's a way of life. Spanish is part of my culture and I learned to communicate and understand my culture through Spanish. I became part of an Aztec dancing group. I was able to connect with more bilingual speakers and learn more about where my ancestors come from and another side of history that is not taught in History Class. Spanish helped me embrace and find my identity. Spanish expanded my horizon and has allowed me to help others connect with their culture and embrace bilingualism.\n\nDescribe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. \n\nA significant education opportunity is getting accepted to got accepted into CDC. The CDC program is a nine-month long course funded by Comcast. The purpose of this program is to teach money management, hardware, coding, and public speaking skills to everyone who got accepted in the community. I have always had an interest in technology and business, but I could not afford the cost of a program like this. Throughout the program, I got the opportunity to network with different companies such as Lyft, Twitter, and NetApp. This program taught me about different tech companies and helped me expand the different tech industries and learn new coding and computer skills through hands on experience. Through this program, I was able to network with many people in the tech industry in this program, I was able to learn how to take apart and put together a console. through this program, I found an interest in coding, was able to learn about HTML, and started designing my own business website. I learned everything this program had to offer and from this program, I was able to do a Latino Leadership Program by being invited by the Professor. This program gave me the opportunity to help small businesses by expanding their business profiles. One of the businesses I worked with was Little Angels Family Daycare. Coming from a low-income family, I never imagined I would be able to help others. I was extremely fortunate to be accepted into free programs that gave me the opportunity to explore business and technology.Learning from my own experience, I realized without help I would have never been able to participate in these programs so I decided to teach others about technology, such as coding.\n\n What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? \n\nI pride myself in being able to give back to my community and school by teaching English to Spanish speakers and Spanish to English Speakers. My junior year of highschool I  learned of the opportunities many people do not have because of the language they speak. To help others, I joined the Spanglish club. The Spanglish club was a club at my school that taught English and Spanish to whoever wanted to learn more of that language. The meetings were every Wednesday during lunch in which I would teach English to Juan Mora. Juan understood some English, but was very shy to speak in English due to his accent. After, the first month of the Spanglish club, both Juan and I realized one hour a week was not enough time to learn English. We decided to meet after school as well, for twice a week from 4 pm-7:30pm. I was able to teach Juan English enough till he felt comfortable speaking to others in English. This was important for me to teach Juan because that was his last year of high school knowing little English is difficult finding a job in any industry. Teaching Juan and many other members of the Spanglish Club English and Spanish has helped them to be able to communicate, translate, and understand others better. I took joy in having the opportunity to give back to my community. Through the CDC program, I was able to help small local businesses with latino owners learn more about how put their business on the web. I enjoy helping my community which is why starting next week I am going to help small local business expand their business by creating a website, yelp account, g suite, domain, and google location consulting, and more. I am going to be able to help my community by being part of the Summer Youth Latino Leadership Program.","prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","year":2017,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"California","featured":"false","image":772,"date":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c8f-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"Prompt: Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.\n\nI won “Most Original” pumpkin at a Halloween party years ago. I have the “Most Original” award. It’s a consolation prize. You can’t be the best, or the prettiest, so you have to be “original.” I’ve won the “Most Original” award a fair number of times. I was even named “Most Original” at a basketball awards banquet. What does that even mean? How can anybody be “Most Original” when she’s playing basketball?\n\nRecognizing the “Most Original” award for the pity-prize that it was, I grew increasingly hostile toward the very word “original.” If you win this cursed award, everyone around you offers feigned sympathy or, even worse, insincere congratulations. Phrases like “oh, bummer” or well-intentioned but half-hearted “well, good for you” circle the recipient, creating a cyclone of regret from which the “winner” will never recover.\n\nOkay, maybe I’m overreacting – but I cannot for the life of me understand that award. “Most Original” always let me down, and as a result, I hated to be original in any context. In my hometown of New Haven, Connecticut, where normality was…well, the norm, I tried to be a typical student – absolutely, perfectly normal. I blended into crowds, the definition of typical. I became a person who refused to surprise people. Just another brick in the wall.\n\nDull.\n\nAnd then I moved to Berkeley for six months. It’s an odd, vibrant place with odd, vibrant people. Originality is celebrated there – not in the half-hearted “good for you” way, but in the full-throated “GOOD FOR YOU!” way. One of the first of my fellow students to befriend me wore corset tops and tutus and carried a parasol with which she punctuated her every utterance. Her best friend was a boy with purple hair who once wore a shirt with built in LED lights for Christmas. They were the most popular people in school, in direct contrast to all that was socially acceptable in New Haven. Our peers recognized them as being unique, but instead of ostracizing them or pitying them, the students in Berkeley celebrated them.\n\nIn Berkeley, I learned the value of originality: Those who celebrate their individuality are not only unique but strong. It takes great strength to defy the definitions of others, and because of that strength, those who create their own paths discover a different world than those who travel the same worn road.\n\nI returned to New Haven a changed person. My appearance was certainly different – red streaks in my hair and a newfound fondness for tutus certainly made me stand out. But the change went deeper than that: I had embraced the idea of being myself, no matter what others thought was cool or “normal.” Spending time in a place where “Most Original” was the highest compliment allowed me to explore myself without fear of being different or lesser, and I liked what I had found.\n\nI’m still skeptical about the “Most Original” award. In the context of an award ceremony, it’s still just a meaningless consolation prize. But I don’t think of being “Most original” as an insult anymore – I wear it as a badge of honor, proof that I am myself and no one else.\n\nA friend recently joked, “If there were a ‘Quirkiest’ award in the yearbook, you’d definitely win.” We were standing outside of a classroom, and I was wearing a pair of gold, glittery shorts that definitely caught the eye. “Quirkiest?” I said. “How about ‘Most Original.’”\n\nWhat Works\n\nThis writer’s style clearly shows off her sense of humor. If one of the purposes of a college essay is to make yourself come to life off the page, then this essay hits the mark. Far from seeming unfinished or unedited, the somewhat stream-of-consciousness style establishes a humorous and self-deprecating tone that makes the reader instantly like the applicant. More than anything else, it is this writing style that elevates what could have been a fairly superficial statement of personal growth into a truly informative story that showcases the author’s personality.","prompt":"","college":"","year":"","status":"","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"","image":532,"date":"2018-11-17T21:35:22.983Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0},{"id":"64f99c90-fea1-11e8-b083-4ff0e3669c64","essay":"When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Watkins was the coordinator of the foreign exchange student program I was enrolled in. She had a nine year old son named Cody. I would babysit Cody every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me from Charlotte’s Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him and ask him the meanings of certain words. He was my first friend in the New World.\n\nMy second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of the Watkins’s. The host dad Michael was a high school English teacher and the host mom Jennifer (who had me call her “Jen”) taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. The Martinez family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days, Michael, Jen and I would sit on the porch and listen to the rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad.\n\nAfter I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. I wanted to see new places and meet different people. Since I wasn’t an exchange student anymore, I had the freedom--and burden--of finding a new school and host family on my own. After a few days of thorough investigation, I found the Struiksma family in California. They were a unique group.\n\nThe host mom Shellie was a single mom who had two of her own sons and two Russian daughters that she had adopted. The kids always had something warm to eat, and were always on their best behavior at home and in school. It would be fair to say that this was all due to Shellie’s upbringing. My room was on the first floor, right in front of Shellie’s hair salon, a small business that she ran out of her home. In the living room were six or seven huge amplifiers and a gigantic chandelier hung from the high ceiling. The kitchen had a bar. At first, the non-stop visits from strangers made me nervous, but soon I got used to them. I remember one night, a couple barged into my room while I was sleeping. It was awkward.\n\nAfter a few months I realized we weren’t the best fit. In the nicest way possible, I told them I had to leave. They understood.\n\nThe Ortiz family was my fourth family. Kimberly, the host mom, treated me the same way she treated her own son. She made me do chores: I fixed dinner, fed their two dogs Sassy and Lady, and once a week I cleaned the bathroom. I also had to follow some rules: No food in my room, no using the family computer, no lights on after midnight, and no ride unless it was an emergency. The first couple of months were really hard to get used to, but eventually I adjusted.\n\nI lived with the Ortiz family for seven months like a monk in the deep forest. However, the host dad Greg’s asthma got worse after winter, so he wanted to move to the countryside. It was unexpected and I only had a week to find a new host family. I asked my friend Danielle if I could live with her until I found a new home. That’s how I met the Dirksen family, my fifth family.\n\nThe Dirksen family had three kids. They were all different. Danielle liked bitter black coffee, Christian liked energy drinks, and Becca liked sweet lemon tea. Dawn, the host mom didn’t like winter, and Mark, the host dad, didn’t like summer. After dinner, we would all play Wii Sports together. I was the king of bowling, and Dawn was the queen of tennis. I don’t remember a single time that they argued about the games. Afterward, we would gather in the living room and Danielle would play the piano while the rest of us sang hymns.\n\nOf course, those 28 months were too short to fully understand all five families, but I learned from and was shaped by each of them. By teaching me English, nine year-old Cody taught me the importance of being able to learn from anyone; the Martinez family showed me the value of spending time together as a family; the Struiksma family taught me to reserve judgment about divorced women and adopted children; Mrs. Ortiz taught me the value of discipline and the Dirksen family taught me the importance of appreciating one another’s different qualities.\n\nGetting along with other people is necessary for anyone and living with five families has made me more sensitive to others’ needs: I have learned how to recognize when someone needs to talk, when I should give advice and when to simply listen, and when someone needs to be left alone; in the process, I have become much more adaptable. I’m ready to change, learn, and be shaped by my future families.","prompt":"Common App","college":"","year":2018,"status":"accepted","author":"","email":"","country":"United States","state":"","featured":"true","image":853,"date":"2018-11-11T06:12:04.346Z","source":"","comments":"","views":0}]}
